59up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
60in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
61a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
62look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a

68We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
69fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
70to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
71searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
72projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
73per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
74million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text
75files per month:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
76The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
77Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
78This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
79which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
80of the year 2001.

247THE SONNETS
248
249by William Shakespeare
250
251
252
253                     1
254  From fairest creatures we desire increase,
255  That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
256  But as the riper should by time decease,
257  His tender heir might bear his memory:
258  But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
259  Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
260  Making a famine where abundance lies,
261  Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
262  Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
263  And only herald to the gaudy spring,
264  Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
265  And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
266    Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
267    To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
268
269
270                     2
271  When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
272  And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
273  Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
274  Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:  
275  Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
276  Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
277  To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,
278  Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
279  How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
280  If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
281  Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'
282  Proving his beauty by succession thine.
283    This were to be new made when thou art old,
284    And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
285
286
287                     3
288  Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,
289  Now is the time that face should form another,
290  Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
291  Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
292  For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
293  Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
294  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
295  Of his self-love to stop posterity?  
296  Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
297  Calls back the lovely April of her prime,
298  So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
299  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
300    But if thou live remembered not to be,
301    Die single and thine image dies with thee.
302
303
304                     4
305  Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,
306  Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
307  Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
308  And being frank she lends to those are free:
309  Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,
310  The bounteous largess given thee to give?
311  Profitless usurer why dost thou use
312  So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?
313  For having traffic with thy self alone,
314  Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,
315  Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,
316  What acceptable audit canst thou leave?  
317    Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
318    Which used lives th' executor to be.
319
320
321                     5
322  Those hours that with gentle work did frame
323  The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
324  Will play the tyrants to the very same,
325  And that unfair which fairly doth excel:
326  For never-resting time leads summer on
327  To hideous winter and confounds him there,
328  Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
329  Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:
330  Then were not summer's distillation left
331  A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
332  Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
333  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.
334    But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,
335    Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.
336
337
338                     6  
339  Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,
340  In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:
341  Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,
342  With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed:
343  That use is not forbidden usury,
344  Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
345  That's for thy self to breed another thee,
346  Or ten times happier be it ten for one,
347  Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
348  If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
349  Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
350  Leaving thee living in posterity?
351    Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,
352    To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
353
354
355                     7
356  Lo in the orient when the gracious light
357  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
358  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
359  Serving with looks his sacred majesty,  
360  And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,
361  Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
362  Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
363  Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
364  But when from highmost pitch with weary car,
365  Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,
366  The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are
367  From his low tract and look another way:
368    So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:
369    Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.
370
371
372                     8
373  Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
374  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
375  Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
376  Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
377  If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
378  By unions married do offend thine ear,
379  They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
380  In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:  
381  Mark how one string sweet husband to another,
382  Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
383  Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,
384  Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
385    Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
386    Sings this to thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none'.
387
388
389                     9
390  Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,
391  That thou consum'st thy self in single life?
392  Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
393  The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,
394  The world will be thy widow and still weep,
395  That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
396  When every private widow well may keep,
397  By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:
398  Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
399  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
400  But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
401  And kept unused the user so destroys it:  
402    No love toward others in that bosom sits
403    That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.
404
405
406                     10
407  For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
408  Who for thy self art so unprovident.
409  Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
410  But that thou none lov'st is most evident:
411  For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate,
412  That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,
413  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
414  Which to repair should be thy chief desire:
415  O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,
416  Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
417  Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,
418  Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,
419    Make thee another self for love of me,
420    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
421
422
423                     11  
424  As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st,
425  In one of thine, from that which thou departest,
426  And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,
427  Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,
428  Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,
429  Without this folly, age, and cold decay,
430  If all were minded so, the times should cease,
431  And threescore year would make the world away:
432  Let those whom nature hath not made for store,
433  Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:
434  Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;
435  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
436    She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,
437    Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.
438
439
440                     12
441  When I do count the clock that tells the time,
442  And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,
443  When I behold the violet past prime,
444  And sable curls all silvered o'er with white:  
445  When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
446  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
447  And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
448  Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:
449  Then of thy beauty do I question make
450  That thou among the wastes of time must go,
451  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,
452  And die as fast as they see others grow,
453    And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
454    Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.
455
456
457                     13
458  O that you were your self, but love you are
459  No longer yours, than you your self here live,
460  Against this coming end you should prepare,
461  And your sweet semblance to some other give.
462  So should that beauty which you hold in lease
463  Find no determination, then you were
464  Your self again after your self's decease,
465  When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.  
466  Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
467  Which husbandry in honour might uphold,
468  Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
469  And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
470    O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,
471    You had a father, let your son say so.
472
473
474                     14
475  Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,
476  And yet methinks I have astronomy,
477  But not to tell of good, or evil luck,
478  Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality,
479  Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;
480  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
481  Or say with princes if it shall go well
482  By oft predict that I in heaven find.
483  But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
484  And constant stars in them I read such art
485  As truth and beauty shall together thrive
486  If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:  
487    Or else of thee this I prognosticate,
488    Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
489
490
491                     15
492  When I consider every thing that grows
493  Holds in perfection but a little moment.
494  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
495  Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.
496  When I perceive that men as plants increase,
497  Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:
498  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
499  And wear their brave state out of memory.
500  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,
501  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
502  Where wasteful time debateth with decay
503  To change your day of youth to sullied night,
504    And all in war with Time for love of you,
505    As he takes from you, I engraft you new.
506
507
508                     16  
509  But wherefore do not you a mightier way
510  Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?
511  And fortify your self in your decay
512  With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
513  Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
514  And many maiden gardens yet unset,
515  With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
516  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
517  So should the lines of life that life repair
518  Which this (Time's pencil) or my pupil pen
519  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
520  Can make you live your self in eyes of men.
521    To give away your self, keeps your self still,
522    And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.
523
524
525                     17
526  Who will believe my verse in time to come
527  If it were filled with your most high deserts?
528  Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
529  Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:  
530  If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
531  And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
532  The age to come would say this poet lies,
533  Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.
534  So should my papers (yellowed with their age)
535  Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
536  And your true rights be termed a poet's rage,
537  And stretched metre of an antique song.
538    But were some child of yours alive that time,
539    You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.
540
541
542                     18
543  Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
544  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
545  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
546  And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
547  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
548  And often is his gold complexion dimmed,
549  And every fair from fair sometime declines,
550  By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:  
551  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
552  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
553  Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
554  When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
555    So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
556    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
557
558
559                     19
560  Devouring Time blunt thou the lion's paws,
561  And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,
562  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
563  And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,
564  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st,
565  And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time
566  To the wide world and all her fading sweets:
567  But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,
568  O carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
569  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,
570  Him in thy course untainted do allow,
571  For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.  
572    Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,
573    My love shall in my verse ever live young.
574
575
576                     20
577  A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
578  Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,
579  A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
580  With shifting change as is false women's fashion,
581  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:
582  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,
583  A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
584  Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
585  And for a woman wert thou first created,
586  Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,
587  And by addition me of thee defeated,
588  By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
589    But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,
590    Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
591
592
593                     21  
594  So is it not with me as with that muse,
595  Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,
596  Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,
597  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
598  Making a couplement of proud compare
599  With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems:
600  With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,
601  That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
602  O let me true in love but truly write,
603  And then believe me, my love is as fair,
604  As any mother's child, though not so bright
605  As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:
606    Let them say more that like of hearsay well,
607    I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
608
609
610                     22
611  My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
612  So long as youth and thou are of one date,
613  But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
614  Then look I death my days should expiate.  
615  For all that beauty that doth cover thee,
616  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
617  Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,
618  How can I then be elder than thou art?
619  O therefore love be of thyself so wary,
620  As I not for my self, but for thee will,
621  Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary
622  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
623    Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,
624    Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.
625
626
627                     23
628  As an unperfect actor on the stage,
629  Who with his fear is put beside his part,
630  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
631  Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
632  So I for fear of trust, forget to say,
633  The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
634  And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
635  O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might:  
636  O let my looks be then the eloquence,
637  And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
638  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
639  More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.
640    O learn to read what silent love hath writ,
641    To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.
642
643
644                     24
645  Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,
646  Thy beauty's form in table of my heart,
647  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
648  And perspective it is best painter's art.
649  For through the painter must you see his skill,
650  To find where your true image pictured lies,
651  Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
652  That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:
653  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,
654  Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
655  Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
656  Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;  
657    Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
658    They draw but what they see, know not the heart.
659
660
661                     25
662  Let those who are in favour with their stars,
663  Of public honour and proud titles boast,
664  Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
665  Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;
666  Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread,
667  But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
668  And in themselves their pride lies buried,
669  For at a frown they in their glory die.
670  The painful warrior famoused for fight,
671  After a thousand victories once foiled,
672  Is from the book of honour razed quite,
673  And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:
674    Then happy I that love and am beloved
675    Where I may not remove nor be removed.
676
677
678                     26  
679  Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
680  Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;
681  To thee I send this written embassage
682  To witness duty, not to show my wit.
683  Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
684  May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;
685  But that I hope some good conceit of thine
686  In thy soul's thought (all naked) will bestow it:
687  Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,
688  Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
689  And puts apparel on my tattered loving,
690  To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,
691    Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,
692    Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.
693
694
695                     27
696  Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
697  The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,
698  But then begins a journey in my head
699  To work my mind, when body's work's expired.  
700  For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)
701  Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
702  And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
703  Looking on darkness which the blind do see.
704  Save that my soul's imaginary sight
705  Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
706  Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)
707  Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
708    Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,
709    For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.
710
711
712                     28
713  How can I then return in happy plight
714  That am debarred the benefit of rest?
715  When day's oppression is not eased by night,
716  But day by night and night by day oppressed.
717  And each (though enemies to either's reign)
718  Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
719  The one by toil, the other to complain
720  How far I toil, still farther off from thee.  
721  I tell the day to please him thou art bright,
722  And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
723  So flatter I the swart-complexioned night,
724  When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
725    But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,
726    And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger
727
728
729                     29
730  When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes,
731  I all alone beweep my outcast state,
732  And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
733  And look upon my self and curse my fate,
734  Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
735  Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
736  Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
737  With what I most enjoy contented least,
738  Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,
739  Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
740  (Like to the lark at break of day arising
741  From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate,  
742    For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,
743    That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
744
745
746                     30
747  When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,
748  I summon up remembrance of things past,
749  I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
750  And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
751  Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)
752  For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
753  And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,
754  And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.
755  Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
756  And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
757  The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
758  Which I new pay as if not paid before.
759    But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)
760    All losses are restored, and sorrows end.
761
762
763                     31  
764  Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
765  Which I by lacking have supposed dead,
766  And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,
767  And all those friends which I thought buried.
768  How many a holy and obsequious tear
769  Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
770  As interest of the dead, which now appear,
771  But things removed that hidden in thee lie.
772  Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
773  Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
774  Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
775  That due of many, now is thine alone.
776    Their images I loved, I view in thee,
777    And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.
778
779
780                     32
781  If thou survive my well-contented day,
782  When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
783  And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
784  These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:  
785  Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
786  And though they be outstripped by every pen,
787  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
788  Exceeded by the height of happier men.
789  O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,
790  'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,
791  A dearer birth than this his love had brought
792  To march in ranks of better equipage:
793    But since he died and poets better prove,
794    Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.
795
796
797                     33
798  Full many a glorious morning have I seen,
799  Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
800  Kissing with golden face the meadows green;
801  Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:
802  Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,
803  With ugly rack on his celestial face,
804  And from the forlorn world his visage hide
805  Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:  
806  Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
807  With all triumphant splendour on my brow,
808  But out alack, he was but one hour mine,
809  The region cloud hath masked him from me now.
810    Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,
811    Suns of the world may stain, when heaven's sun staineth.
812
813
814                     34
815  Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
816  And make me travel forth without my cloak,
817  To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
818  Hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke?
819  'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
820  To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
821  For no man well of such a salve can speak,
822  That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:
823  Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,
824  Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss,
825  Th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
826  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.  
827    Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
828    And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.
829
830
831                     35
832  No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,
833  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,
834  Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
835  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
836  All men make faults, and even I in this,
837  Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
838  My self corrupting salving thy amiss,
839  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:
840  For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,
841  Thy adverse party is thy advocate,
842  And 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence:
843  Such civil war is in my love and hate,
844    That I an accessary needs must be,
845    To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.
846
847
848                     36  
849  Let me confess that we two must be twain,
850  Although our undivided loves are one:
851  So shall those blots that do with me remain,
852  Without thy help, by me be borne alone.
853  In our two loves there is but one respect,
854  Though in our lives a separable spite,
855  Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
856  Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
857  I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
858  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
859  Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
860  Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
861    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
862    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
863
864
865                     37
866  As a decrepit father takes delight,
867  To see his active child do deeds of youth,
868  So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite
869  Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.  
870  For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
871  Or any of these all, or all, or more
872  Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,
873  I make my love engrafted to this store:
874  So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,
875  Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,
876  That I in thy abundance am sufficed,
877  And by a part of all thy glory live:
878    Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,
879    This wish I have, then ten times happy me.
880
881
882                     38
883  How can my muse want subject to invent
884  While thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse,
885  Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,
886  For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
887  O give thy self the thanks if aught in me,
888  Worthy perusal stand against thy sight,
889  For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
890  When thou thy self dost give invention light?  
891  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
892  Than those old nine which rhymers invocate,
893  And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
894  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
895    If my slight muse do please these curious days,
896    The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.
897
898
899                     39
900  O how thy worth with manners may I sing,
901  When thou art all the better part of me?
902  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:
903  And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
904  Even for this, let us divided live,
905  And our dear love lose name of single one,
906  That by this separation I may give:
907  That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone:
908  O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,
909  Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
910  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
911  Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.  
912    And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
913    By praising him here who doth hence remain.
914
915
916                     40
917  Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,
918  What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
919  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,
920  All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:
921  Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,
922  I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,
923  But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest
924  By wilful taste of what thy self refusest.
925  I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
926  Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
927  And yet love knows it is a greater grief
928  To bear greater wrong, than hate's known injury.
929    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
930    Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.
931
932
933                     41  
934  Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,
935  When I am sometime absent from thy heart,
936  Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,
937  For still temptation follows where thou art.
938  Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,
939  Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.
940  And when a woman woos, what woman's son,
941  Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?
942  Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
943  And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,
944  Who lead thee in their riot even there
945  Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:
946    Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
947    Thine by thy beauty being false to me.
948
949
950                     42
951  That thou hast her it is not all my grief,
952  And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,
953  That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
954  A loss in love that touches me more nearly.  
955  Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,
956  Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her,
957  And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
958  Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her.
959  If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
960  And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,
961  Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
962  And both for my sake lay on me this cross,
963    But here's the joy, my friend and I are one,
964    Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.
965
966
967                     43
968  When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,
969  For all the day they view things unrespected,
970  But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
971  And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.
972  Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
973  How would thy shadow's form, form happy show,
974  To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
975  When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!  
976  How would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,
977  By looking on thee in the living day,
978  When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,
979  Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
980    All days are nights to see till I see thee,
981    And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.

985  If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
986  Injurious distance should not stop my way,
987  For then despite of space I would be brought,
988  From limits far remote, where thou dost stay,
989  No matter then although my foot did stand
990  Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,
991  For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,
992  As soon as think the place where he would be.
993  But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought
994  To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
995  But that so much of earth and water wrought,
996  I must attend, time's leisure with my moan.  
997    Receiving nought by elements so slow,
998    But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.
999
1000
1001                     45
1002  The other two, slight air, and purging fire,
1003  Are both with thee, wherever I abide,
1004  The first my thought, the other my desire,
1005  These present-absent with swift motion slide.
1006  For when these quicker elements are gone
1007  In tender embassy of love to thee,
1008  My life being made of four, with two alone,
1009  Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.
1010  Until life's composition be recured,
1011  By those swift messengers returned from thee,
1012  Who even but now come back again assured,
1013  Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.
1014    This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,
1015    I send them back again and straight grow sad.
1016
1017
1018                     46  
1019  Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,
1020  How to divide the conquest of thy sight,
1021  Mine eye, my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
1022  My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,
1023  My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,
1024  (A closet never pierced with crystal eyes)
1025  But the defendant doth that plea deny,
1026  And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
1027  To side this title is impanelled
1028  A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
1029  And by their verdict is determined
1030  The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part.
1031    As thus, mine eye's due is thy outward part,
1032    And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.
1033
1034
1035                     47
1036  Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
1037  And each doth good turns now unto the other,
1038  When that mine eye is famished for a look,
1039  Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;  
1040  With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,
1041  And to the painted banquet bids my heart:
1042  Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
1043  And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.
1044  So either by thy picture or my love,
1045  Thy self away, art present still with me,
1046  For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
1047  And I am still with them, and they with thee.
1048    Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
1049    Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.
1050
1051
1052                     48
1053  How careful was I when I took my way,
1054  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
1055  That to my use it might unused stay
1056  From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!
1057  But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
1058  Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,
1059  Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,
1060  Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.  
1061  Thee have I not locked up in any chest,
1062  Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
1063  Within the gentle closure of my breast,
1064  From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,
1065    And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,
1066    For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.
1067
1068
1069                     49
1070  Against that time (if ever that time come)
1071  When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
1072  When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
1073  Called to that audit by advised respects,
1074  Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
1075  And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,
1076  When love converted from the thing it was
1077  Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
1078  Against that time do I ensconce me here
1079  Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
1080  And this my hand, against my self uprear,
1081  To guard the lawful reasons on thy part,  
1082    To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,
1083    Since why to love, I can allege no cause.
1084
1085
1086                     50
1087  How heavy do I journey on the way,
1088  When what I seek (my weary travel's end)
1089  Doth teach that case and that repose to say
1090  'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.'
1091  The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
1092  Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,
1093  As if by some instinct the wretch did know
1094  His rider loved not speed being made from thee:
1095  The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,
1096  That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,
1097  Which heavily he answers with a groan,
1098  More sharp to me than spurring to his side,
1099    For that same groan doth put this in my mind,
1100    My grief lies onward and my joy behind.
1101
1102
1103                     51  
1104  Thus can my love excuse the slow offence,
1105  Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,
1106  From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?
1107  Till I return of posting is no need.
1108  O what excuse will my poor beast then find,
1109  When swift extremity can seem but slow?
1110  Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,
1111  In winged speed no motion shall I know,
1112  Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,
1113  Therefore desire (of perfect'st love being made)
1114  Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,
1115  But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,
1116    Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,
1117    Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.
1118
1119
1120                     52
1121  So am I as the rich whose blessed key,
1122  Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
1123  The which he will not every hour survey,
1124  For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.  
1125  Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
1126  Since seldom coming in that long year set,
1127  Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
1128  Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
1129  So is the time that keeps you as my chest
1130  Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
1131  To make some special instant special-blest,
1132  By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.
1133    Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,
1134    Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.
1135
1136
1137                     53
1138  What is your substance, whereof are you made,
1139  That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
1140  Since every one, hath every one, one shade,
1141  And you but one, can every shadow lend:
1142  Describe Adonis and the counterfeit,
1143  Is poorly imitated after you,
1144  On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
1145  And you in Grecian tires are painted new:  
1146  Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,
1147  The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
1148  The other as your bounty doth appear,
1149  And you in every blessed shape we know.
1150    In all external grace you have some part,
1151    But you like none, none you for constant heart.
1152
1153
1154                     54
1155  O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,
1156  By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!
1157  The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
1158  For that sweet odour, which doth in it live:
1159  The canker blooms have full as deep a dye,
1160  As the perfumed tincture of the roses,
1161  Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,
1162  When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
1163  But for their virtue only is their show,
1164  They live unwooed, and unrespected fade,
1165  Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,
1166  Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:  
1167    And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
1168    When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.
1169
1170
1171                     55
1172  Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
1173  Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,
1174  But you shall shine more bright in these contents
1175  Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.
1176  When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
1177  And broils root out the work of masonry,
1178  Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn:
1179  The living record of your memory.
1180  'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity
1181  Shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room,
1182  Even in the eyes of all posterity
1183  That wear this world out to the ending doom.
1184    So till the judgment that your self arise,
1185    You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.
1186
1187
1188                     56  
1189  Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said
1190  Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
1191  Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,
1192  To-morrow sharpened in his former might.
1193  So love be thou, although to-day thou fill
1194  Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,
1195  To-morrow see again, and do not kill
1196  The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:
1197  Let this sad interim like the ocean be
1198  Which parts the shore, where two contracted new,
1199  Come daily to the banks, that when they see:
1200  Return of love, more blest may be the view.
1201    Or call it winter, which being full of care,
1202    Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.
1203
1204
1205                     57
1206  Being your slave what should I do but tend,
1207  Upon the hours, and times of your desire?
1208  I have no precious time at all to spend;
1209  Nor services to do till you require.  
1210  Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,
1211  Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,
1212  Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,
1213  When you have bid your servant once adieu.
1214  Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,
1215  Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
1216  But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
1217  Save where you are, how happy you make those.
1218    So true a fool is love, that in your will,
1219    (Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.
1220
1221
1222                     58
1223  That god forbid, that made me first your slave,
1224  I should in thought control your times of pleasure,
1225  Or at your hand th' account of hours to crave,
1226  Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure.
1227  O let me suffer (being at your beck)
1228  Th' imprisoned absence of your liberty,
1229  And patience tame to sufferance bide each check,
1230  Without accusing you of injury.  
1231  Be where you list, your charter is so strong,
1232  That you your self may privilage your time
1233  To what you will, to you it doth belong,
1234  Your self to pardon of self-doing crime.
1235    I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,
1236    Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.
1237
1238
1239                     59
1240  If there be nothing new, but that which is,
1241  Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,
1242  Which labouring for invention bear amis
1243  The second burthen of a former child!
1244  O that record could with a backward look,
1245  Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
1246  Show me your image in some antique book,
1247  Since mind at first in character was done.
1248  That I might see what the old world could say,
1249  To this composed wonder of your frame,
1250  Whether we are mended, or whether better they,
1251  Or whether revolution be the same.  
1252    O sure I am the wits of former days,
1253    To subjects worse have given admiring praise.
1254
1255
1256                     60
1257  Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
1258  So do our minutes hasten to their end,
1259  Each changing place with that which goes before,
1260  In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
1261  Nativity once in the main of light,
1262  Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,
1263  Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
1264  And Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.
1265  Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,
1266  And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
1267  Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
1268  And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.
1269    And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand
1270    Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.
1271
1272
1273                     61  
1274  Is it thy will, thy image should keep open
1275  My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
1276  Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
1277  While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
1278  Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
1279  So far from home into my deeds to pry,
1280  To find out shames and idle hours in me,
1281  The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?
1282  O no, thy love though much, is not so great,
1283  It is my love that keeps mine eye awake,
1284  Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
1285  To play the watchman ever for thy sake.
1286    For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,
1287    From me far off, with others all too near.
1288
1289
1290                     62
1291  Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,
1292  And all my soul, and all my every part;
1293  And for this sin there is no remedy,
1294  It is so grounded inward in my heart.  
1295  Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
1296  No shape so true, no truth of such account,
1297  And for my self mine own worth do define,
1298  As I all other in all worths surmount.
1299  But when my glass shows me my self indeed
1300  beated and chopt with tanned antiquity,
1301  Mine own self-love quite contrary I read:
1302  Self, so self-loving were iniquity.
1303    'Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,
1304    Painting my age with beauty of thy days.
1305
1306
1307                     63
1308  Against my love shall be as I am now
1309  With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn,
1310  When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
1311  With lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn
1312  Hath travelled on to age's steepy night,
1313  And all those beauties whereof now he's king
1314  Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
1315  Stealing away the treasure of his spring:  
1316  For such a time do I now fortify
1317  Against confounding age's cruel knife,
1318  That he shall never cut from memory
1319  My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life.
1320    His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
1321    And they shall live, and he in them still green.
1322
1323
1324                     64
1325  When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced
1326  The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age,
1327  When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,
1328  And brass eternal slave to mortal rage.
1329  When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
1330  Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
1331  And the firm soil win of the watery main,
1332  Increasing store with loss, and loss with store.
1333  When I have seen such interchange of State,
1334  Or state it self confounded, to decay,
1335  Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
1336  That Time will come and take my love away.  
1337    This thought is as a death which cannot choose
1338    But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.
1339
1340
1341                     65
1342  Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
1343  But sad mortality o'ersways their power,
1344  How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
1345  Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
1346  O how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
1347  Against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days,
1348  When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
1349  Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays?
1350  O fearful meditation, where alack,
1351  Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
1352  Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,
1353  Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
1354    O none, unless this miracle have might,
1355    That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
1356
1357
1358                     66  
1359  Tired with all these for restful death I cry,
1360  As to behold desert a beggar born,
1361  And needy nothing trimmed in jollity,
1362  And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
1363  And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,
1364  And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
1365  And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
1366  And strength by limping sway disabled
1367  And art made tongue-tied by authority,
1368  And folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,
1369  And simple truth miscalled simplicity,
1370  And captive good attending captain ill.
1371    Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,
1372    Save that to die, I leave my love alone.
1373
1374
1375                     67
1376  Ah wherefore with infection should he live,
1377  And with his presence grace impiety,
1378  That sin by him advantage should achieve,
1379  And lace it self with his society?  
1380  Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
1381  And steal dead seeming of his living hue?
1382  Why should poor beauty indirectly seek,
1383  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
1384  Why should he live, now nature bankrupt is,
1385  Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins,
1386  For she hath no exchequer now but his,
1387  And proud of many, lives upon his gains?
1388    O him she stores, to show what wealth she had,
1389    In days long since, before these last so bad.
1390
1391
1392                     68
1393  Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
1394  When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
1395  Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
1396  Or durst inhabit on a living brow:
1397  Before the golden tresses of the dead,
1398  The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
1399  To live a second life on second head,
1400  Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:  
1401  In him those holy antique hours are seen,
1402  Without all ornament, it self and true,
1403  Making no summer of another's green,
1404  Robbing no old to dress his beauty new,
1405    And him as for a map doth Nature store,
1406    To show false Art what beauty was of yore.
1407
1408
1409                     69
1410  Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view,
1411  Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend:
1412  All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,
1413  Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.
1414  Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,
1415  But those same tongues that give thee so thine own,
1416  In other accents do this praise confound
1417  By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
1418  They look into the beauty of thy mind,
1419  And that in guess they measure by thy deeds,
1420  Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)
1421  To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:  
1422    But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
1423    The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.
1424
1425
1426                     70
1427  That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,
1428  For slander's mark was ever yet the fair,
1429  The ornament of beauty is suspect,
1430  A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
1431  So thou be good, slander doth but approve,
1432  Thy worth the greater being wooed of time,
1433  For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
1434  And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
1435  Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days,
1436  Either not assailed, or victor being charged,
1437  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
1438  To tie up envy, evermore enlarged,
1439    If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,
1440    Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.
1441
1442
1443                     71  
1444  No longer mourn for me when I am dead,
1445  Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
1446  Give warning to the world that I am fled
1447  From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
1448  Nay if you read this line, remember not,
1449  The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
1450  That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
1451  If thinking on me then should make you woe.
1452  O if (I say) you look upon this verse,
1453  When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,
1454  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
1455  But let your love even with my life decay.
1456    Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
1457    And mock you with me after I am gone.
1458
1459
1460                     72
1461  O lest the world should task you to recite,
1462  What merit lived in me that you should love
1463  After my death (dear love) forget me quite,
1464  For you in me can nothing worthy prove.  
1465  Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
1466  To do more for me than mine own desert,
1467  And hang more praise upon deceased I,
1468  Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
1469  O lest your true love may seem false in this,
1470  That you for love speak well of me untrue,
1471  My name be buried where my body is,
1472  And live no more to shame nor me, nor you.
1473    For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
1474    And so should you, to love things nothing worth.
1475
1476
1477                     73
1478  That time of year thou mayst in me behold,
1479  When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang
1480  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
1481  Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
1482  In me thou seest the twilight of such day,
1483  As after sunset fadeth in the west,
1484  Which by and by black night doth take away,
1485  Death's second self that seals up all in rest.  
1486  In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,
1487  That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
1488  As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
1489  Consumed with that which it was nourished by.
1490    This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
1491    To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.
1492
1493
1494                     74
1495  But be contented when that fell arrest,
1496  Without all bail shall carry me away,
1497  My life hath in this line some interest,
1498  Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
1499  When thou reviewest this, thou dost review,
1500  The very part was consecrate to thee,
1501  The earth can have but earth, which is his due,
1502  My spirit is thine the better part of me,
1503  So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
1504  The prey of worms, my body being dead,
1505  The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
1506  Too base of thee to be remembered,  
1507    The worth of that, is that which it contains,
1508    And that is this, and this with thee remains.
1509
1510
1511                     75
1512  So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
1513  Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;
1514  And for the peace of you I hold such strife
1515  As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
1516  Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
1517  Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,
1518  Now counting best to be with you alone,
1519  Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure,
1520  Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
1521  And by and by clean starved for a look,
1522  Possessing or pursuing no delight
1523  Save what is had, or must from you be took.
1524    Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
1525    Or gluttoning on all, or all away.
1526
1527
1528                     76  
1529  Why is my verse so barren of new pride?
1530  So far from variation or quick change?
1531  Why with the time do I not glance aside
1532  To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
1533  Why write I still all one, ever the same,
1534  And keep invention in a noted weed,
1535  That every word doth almost tell my name,
1536  Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
1537  O know sweet love I always write of you,
1538  And you and love are still my argument:
1539  So all my best is dressing old words new,
1540  Spending again what is already spent:
1541    For as the sun is daily new and old,
1542    So is my love still telling what is told.
1543
1544
1545                     77
1546  Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
1547  Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste,
1548  These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
1549  And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.  
1550  The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,
1551  Of mouthed graves will give thee memory,
1552  Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know,
1553  Time's thievish progress to eternity.
1554  Look what thy memory cannot contain,
1555  Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
1556  Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,
1557  To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
1558    These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
1559    Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.
1560
1561
1562                     78
1563  So oft have I invoked thee for my muse,
1564  And found such fair assistance in my verse,
1565  As every alien pen hath got my use,
1566  And under thee their poesy disperse.
1567  Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,
1568  And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,
1569  Have added feathers to the learned's wing,
1570  And given grace a double majesty.
1571  Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
1572  Whose influence is thine, and born of thee,
1573  In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
1574  And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.
1575    But thou art all my art, and dost advance
1576    As high as learning, my rude ignorance.
1577
1578
1579                     79
1580  Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
1581  My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,
1582  But now my gracious numbers are decayed,
1583  And my sick muse doth give an other place.
1584  I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument
1585  Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,
1586  Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent,
1587  He robs thee of, and pays it thee again,
1588  He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word,
1589  From thy behaviour, beauty doth he give
1590  And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
1591  No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.  
1592    Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
1593    Since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay.
1594
1595
1596                     80
1597  O how I faint when I of you do write,
1598  Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,
1599  And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
1600  To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.
1601  But since your worth (wide as the ocean is)
1602  The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
1603  My saucy bark (inferior far to his)
1604  On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
1605  Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
1606  Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,
1607  Or (being wrecked) I am a worthless boat,
1608  He of tall building, and of goodly pride.
1609    Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
1610    The worst was this, my love was my decay.
1611
1612
1613                     81  
1614  Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
1615  Or you survive when I in earth am rotten,
1616  From hence your memory death cannot take,
1617  Although in me each part will be forgotten.
1618  Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
1619  Though I (once gone) to all the world must die,
1620  The earth can yield me but a common grave,
1621  When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie,
1622  Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
1623  Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,
1624  And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
1625  When all the breathers of this world are dead,
1626    You still shall live (such virtue hath my pen)
1627    Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.
1628
1629
1630                     82
1631  I grant thou wert not married to my muse,
1632  And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
1633  The dedicated words which writers use
1634  Of their fair subject, blessing every book.  
1635  Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
1636  Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,
1637  And therefore art enforced to seek anew,
1638  Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
1639  And do so love, yet when they have devised,
1640  What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
1641  Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,
1642  In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.
1643    And their gross painting might be better used,
1644    Where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.
1645
1646
1647                     83
1648  I never saw that you did painting need,
1649  And therefore to your fair no painting set,
1650  I found (or thought I found) you did exceed,
1651  That barren tender of a poet's debt:
1652  And therefore have I slept in your report,
1653  That you your self being extant well might show,
1654  How far a modern quill doth come too short,
1655  Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.  
1656  This silence for my sin you did impute,
1657  Which shall be most my glory being dumb,
1658  For I impair not beauty being mute,
1659  When others would give life, and bring a tomb.
1660    There lives more life in one of your fair eyes,
1661    Than both your poets can in praise devise.
1662
1663
1664                     84
1665  Who is it that says most, which can say more,
1666  Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you?
1667  In whose confine immured is the store,
1668  Which should example where your equal grew.
1669  Lean penury within that pen doth dwell,
1670  That to his subject lends not some small glory,
1671  But he that writes of you, if he can tell,
1672  That you are you, so dignifies his story.
1673  Let him but copy what in you is writ,
1674  Not making worse what nature made so clear,
1675  And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
1676  Making his style admired every where.  
1677    You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
1678    Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.
1679
1680
1681                     85
1682  My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,
1683  While comments of your praise richly compiled,
1684  Reserve their character with golden quill,
1685  And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
1686  I think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,
1687  And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen,
1688  To every hymn that able spirit affords,
1689  In polished form of well refined pen.
1690  Hearing you praised, I say 'tis so, 'tis true,
1691  And to the most of praise add something more,
1692  But that is in my thought, whose love to you
1693  (Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before,
1694    Then others, for the breath of words respect,
1695    Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.
1696
1697
1698                     86  
1699  Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
1700  Bound for the prize of (all too precious) you,
1701  That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
1702  Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
1703  Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
1704  Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
1705  No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
1706  Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
1707  He nor that affable familiar ghost
1708  Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
1709  As victors of my silence cannot boast,
1710  I was not sick of any fear from thence.
1711    But when your countenance filled up his line,
1712    Then lacked I matter, that enfeebled mine.
1713
1714
1715                     87
1716  Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
1717  And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
1718  The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing:
1719  My bonds in thee are all determinate.  
1720  For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,
1721  And for that riches where is my deserving?
1722  The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
1723  And so my patent back again is swerving.
1724  Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
1725  Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking,
1726  So thy great gift upon misprision growing,
1727  Comes home again, on better judgement making.
1728    Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,
1729    In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.
1730
1731
1732                     88
1733  When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,
1734  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
1735  Upon thy side, against my self I'll fight,
1736  And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:
1737  With mine own weakness being best acquainted,
1738  Upon thy part I can set down a story
1739  Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted:
1740  That thou in losing me, shalt win much glory:  
1741  And I by this will be a gainer too,
1742  For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
1743  The injuries that to my self I do,
1744  Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
1745    Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
1746    That for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.
1747
1748
1749                     89
1750  Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
1751  And I will comment upon that offence,
1752  Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt:
1753  Against thy reasons making no defence.
1754  Thou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill,
1755  To set a form upon desired change,
1756  As I'll my self disgrace, knowing thy will,
1757  I will acquaintance strangle and look strange:
1758  Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue,
1759  Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
1760  Lest I (too much profane) should do it wronk:
1761  And haply of our old acquaintance tell.  
1762    For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,
1763    For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.
1764
1765
1766                     90
1767  Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,
1768  Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
1769  join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
1770  And do not drop in for an after-loss:
1771  Ah do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,
1772  Come in the rearward of a conquered woe,
1773  Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
1774  To linger out a purposed overthrow.
1775  If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
1776  When other petty griefs have done their spite,
1777  But in the onset come, so shall I taste
1778  At first the very worst of fortune's might.
1779    And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
1780    Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.
1781
1782
1783                     91  
1784  Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
1785  Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,
1786  Some in their garments though new-fangled ill:
1787  Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse.
1788  And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
1789  Wherein it finds a joy above the rest,
1790  But these particulars are not my measure,
1791  All these I better in one general best.
1792  Thy love is better than high birth to me,
1793  Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,
1794  Of more delight than hawks and horses be:
1795  And having thee, of all men's pride I boast.
1796    Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,
1797    All this away, and me most wretchcd make.
1798
1799
1800                     92
1801  But do thy worst to steal thy self away,
1802  For term of life thou art assured mine,
1803  And life no longer than thy love will stay,
1804  For it depends upon that love of thine.  
1805  Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
1806  When in the least of them my life hath end,
1807  I see, a better state to me belongs
1808  Than that, which on thy humour doth depend.
1809  Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
1810  Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie,
1811  O what a happy title do I find,
1812  Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
1813    But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
1814    Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.
1815
1816
1817                     93
1818  So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
1819  Like a deceived husband, so love's face,
1820  May still seem love to me, though altered new:
1821  Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place.
1822  For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
1823  Therefore in that I cannot know thy change,
1824  In many's looks, the false heart's history
1825  Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.  
1826  But heaven in thy creation did decree,
1827  That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,
1828  Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,
1829  Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.
1830    How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
1831    If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.
1832
1833
1834                     94
1835  They that have power to hurt, and will do none,
1836  That do not do the thing, they most do show,
1837  Who moving others, are themselves as stone,
1838  Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:
1839  They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,
1840  And husband nature's riches from expense,
1841  Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces,
1842  Others, but stewards of their excellence:
1843  The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
1844  Though to it self, it only live and die,
1845  But if that flower with base infection meet,
1846  The basest weed outbraves his dignity:  
1847    For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,
1848    Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.
1849
1850
1851                     95
1852  How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,
1853  Which like a canker in the fragrant rose,
1854  Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
1855  O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
1856  That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
1857  (Making lascivious comments on thy sport)
1858  Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise,
1859  Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.
1860  O what a mansion have those vices got,
1861  Which for their habitation chose out thee,
1862  Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,
1863  And all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!
1864    Take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,
1865    The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.
1866
1867
1868                     96  
1869  Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness,
1870  Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport,
1871  Both grace and faults are loved of more and less:
1872  Thou mak'st faults graces, that to thee resort:
1873  As on the finger of a throned queen,
1874  The basest jewel will be well esteemed:
1875  So are those errors that in thee are seen,
1876  To truths translated, and for true things deemed.
1877  How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
1878  If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
1879  How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
1880  if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
1881    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
1882    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
1883
1884
1885                     97
1886  How like a winter hath my absence been
1887  From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
1888  What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
1889  What old December's bareness everywhere!  
1890  And yet this time removed was summer's time,
1891  The teeming autumn big with rich increase,
1892  Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
1893  Like widowed wombs after their lords' decease:
1894  Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
1895  But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit,
1896  For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
1897  And thou away, the very birds are mute.
1898    Or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,
1899    That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.
1900
1901
1902                     98
1903  From you have I been absent in the spring,
1904  When proud-pied April (dressed in all his trim)
1905  Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing:
1906  That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.
1907  Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
1908  Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
1909  Could make me any summer's story tell:
1910  Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:  
1911  Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
1912  Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,
1913  They were but sweet, but figures of delight:
1914  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
1915    Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,
1916    As with your shadow I with these did play.
1917
1918
1919                     99
1920  The forward violet thus did I chide,
1921  Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
1922  If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
1923  Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells,
1924  In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
1925  The lily I condemned for thy hand,
1926  And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair,
1927  The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
1928  One blushing shame, another white despair:
1929  A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,
1930  And to his robbery had annexed thy breath,
1931  But for his theft in pride of all his growth  
1932  A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
1933    More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,
1934    But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.
1935
1936
1937                     100
1938  Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,
1939  To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
1940  Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
1941  Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
1942  Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,
1943  In gentle numbers time so idly spent,
1944  Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,
1945  And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
1946  Rise resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,
1947  If time have any wrinkle graven there,
1948  If any, be a satire to decay,
1949  And make time's spoils despised everywhere.
1950    Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,
1951    So thou prevent'st his scythe, and crooked knife.
1952
1953  
1954                     101
1955  O truant Muse what shall be thy amends,
1956  For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
1957  Both truth and beauty on my love depends:
1958  So dost thou too, and therein dignified:
1959  Make answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say,
1960  'Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,
1961  Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay:
1962  But best is best, if never intermixed'?
1963  Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
1964  Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee,
1965  To make him much outlive a gilded tomb:
1966  And to be praised of ages yet to be.
1967    Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,
1968    To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.
1969
1970
1971                     102
1972  My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,
1973  I love not less, though less the show appear,
1974  That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,  
1975  The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
1976  Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
1977  When I was wont to greet it with my lays,
1978  As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
1979  And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
1980  Not that the summer is less pleasant now
1981  Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
1982  But that wild music burthens every bough,
1983  And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
1984    Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:
1985    Because I would not dull you with my song.
1986
1987
1988                     103
1989  Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,
1990  That having such a scope to show her pride,
1991  The argument all bare is of more worth
1992  Than when it hath my added praise beside.
1993  O blame me not if I no more can write!
1994  Look in your glass and there appears a face,
1995  That over-goes my blunt invention quite,  
1996  Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.
1997  Were it not sinful then striving to mend,
1998  To mar the subject that before was well?
1999  For to no other pass my verses tend,
2000  Than of your graces and your gifts to tell.
2001    And more, much more than in my verse can sit,
2002    Your own glass shows you, when you look in it.
2003
2004
2005                     104
2006  To me fair friend you never can be old,
2007  For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
2008  Such seems your beauty still: three winters cold,
2009  Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
2010  Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,
2011  In process of the seasons have I seen,
2012  Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,
2013  Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green.
2014  Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand,
2015  Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived,
2016  So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand  
2017  Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived.
2018    For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred,
2019    Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.
2020
2021
2022                     105
2023  Let not my love be called idolatry,
2024  Nor my beloved as an idol show,
2025  Since all alike my songs and praises be
2026  To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
2027  Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
2028  Still constant in a wondrous excellence,
2029  Therefore my verse to constancy confined,
2030  One thing expressing, leaves out difference.
2031  Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,
2032  Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words,
2033  And in this change is my invention spent,
2034  Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
2035    Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone.
2036    Which three till now, never kept seat in one.
2037
2038  
2039                     106
2040  When in the chronicle of wasted time,
2041  I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
2042  And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,
2043  In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,
2044  Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
2045  Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
2046  I see their antique pen would have expressed,
2047  Even such a beauty as you master now.
2048  So all their praises are but prophecies
2049  Of this our time, all you prefiguring,
2050  And for they looked but with divining eyes,
2051  They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
2052    For we which now behold these present days,
2053    Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.
2054
2055
2056                     107
2057  Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul,
2058  Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come,
2059  Can yet the lease of my true love control,  
2060  Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
2061  The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,
2062  And the sad augurs mock their own presage,
2063  Incertainties now crown themselves assured,
2064  And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
2065  Now with the drops of this most balmy time,
2066  My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,
2067  Since spite of him I'll live in this poor rhyme,
2068  While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes.
2069    And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
2070    When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.
2071
2072
2073                     108
2074  What's in the brain that ink may character,
2075  Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit,
2076  What's new to speak, what now to register,
2077  That may express my love, or thy dear merit?
2078  Nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,
2079  I must each day say o'er the very same,
2080  Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,  
2081  Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.
2082  So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
2083  Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
2084  Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
2085  But makes antiquity for aye his page,
2086    Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
2087    Where time and outward form would show it dead.
2088
2089
2090                     109
2091  O never say that I was false of heart,
2092  Though absence seemed my flame to qualify,
2093  As easy might I from my self depart,
2094  As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:
2095  That is my home of love, if I have ranged,
2096  Like him that travels I return again,
2097  Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
2098  So that my self bring water for my stain,
2099  Never believe though in my nature reigned,
2100  All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
2101  That it could so preposterously be stained,  
2102  To leave for nothing all thy sum of good:
2103    For nothing this wide universe I call,
2104    Save thou my rose, in it thou art my all.
2105
2106
2107                     110
2108  Alas 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
2109  And made my self a motley to the view,
2110  Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
2111  Made old offences of affections new.
2112  Most true it is, that I have looked on truth
2113  Askance and strangely: but by all above,
2114  These blenches gave my heart another youth,
2115  And worse essays proved thee my best of love.
2116  Now all is done, have what shall have no end,
2117  Mine appetite I never more will grind
2118  On newer proof, to try an older friend,
2119  A god in love, to whom I am confined.
2120    Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
2121    Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.
2122
2123  
2124                     111
2125  O for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
2126  The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
2127  That did not better for my life provide,
2128  Than public means which public manners breeds.
2129  Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
2130  And almost thence my nature is subdued
2131  To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
2132  Pity me then, and wish I were renewed,
2133  Whilst like a willing patient I will drink,
2134  Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection,
2135  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
2136  Nor double penance to correct correction.
2137    Pity me then dear friend, and I assure ye,
2138    Even that your pity is enough to cure me.
2139
2140
2141                     112
2142  Your love and pity doth th' impression fill,
2143  Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow,
2144  For what care I who calls me well or ill,  
2145  So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
2146  You are my all the world, and I must strive,
2147  To know my shames and praises from your tongue,
2148  None else to me, nor I to none alive,
2149  That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.
2150  In so profound abysm I throw all care
2151  Of others' voices, that my adder's sense,
2152  To critic and to flatterer stopped are:
2153  Mark how with my neglect I do dispense.
2154    You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
2155    That all the world besides methinks are dead.
2156
2157
2158                     113
2159  Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind,
2160  And that which governs me to go about,
2161  Doth part his function, and is partly blind,
2162  Seems seeing, but effectually is out:
2163  For it no form delivers to the heart
2164  Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch,
2165  Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,  
2166  Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
2167  For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,
2168  The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,
2169  The mountain, or the sea, the day, or night:
2170  The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.
2171    Incapable of more, replete with you,
2172    My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.
2173
2174
2175                     114
2176  Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
2177  Drink up the monarch's plague this flattery?
2178  Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,
2179  And that your love taught it this alchemy?
2180  To make of monsters, and things indigest,
2181  Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
2182  Creating every bad a perfect best
2183  As fast as objects to his beams assemble:
2184  O 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,
2185  And my great mind most kingly drinks it up,
2186  Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,  
2187  And to his palate doth prepare the cup.
2188    If it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin,
2189    That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
2190
2191
2192                     115
2193  Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
2194  Even those that said I could not love you dearer,
2195  Yet then my judgment knew no reason why,
2196  My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer,
2197  But reckoning time, whose millioned accidents
2198  Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,
2199  Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
2200  Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things:
2201  Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,
2202  Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'
2203  When I was certain o'er incertainty,
2204  Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
2205    Love is a babe, then might I not say so
2206    To give full growth to that which still doth grow.
2207
2208  
2209                     116
2210  Let me not to the marriage of true minds
2211  Admit impediments, love is not love
2212  Which alters when it alteration finds,
2213  Or bends with the remover to remove.
2214  O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
2215  That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
2216  It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
2217  Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
2218  Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
2219  Within his bending sickle's compass come,
2220  Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
2221  But bears it out even to the edge of doom:
2222    If this be error and upon me proved,
2223    I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
2224
2225
2226                     117
2227  Accuse me thus, that I have scanted all,
2228  Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
2229  Forgot upon your dearest love to call,  
2230  Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day,
2231  That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
2232  And given to time your own dear-purchased right,
2233  That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
2234  Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
2235  Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
2236  And on just proof surmise, accumulate,
2237  Bring me within the level of your frown,
2238  But shoot not at me in your wakened hate:
2239    Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
2240    The constancy and virtue of your love.
2241
2242
2243                     118
2244  Like as to make our appetite more keen
2245  With eager compounds we our palate urge,
2246  As to prevent our maladies unseen,
2247  We sicken to shun sickness when we purge.
2248  Even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
2249  To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
2250  And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,  
2251  To be diseased ere that there was true needing.
2252  Thus policy in love t' anticipate
2253  The ills that were not, grew to faults assured,
2254  And brought to medicine a healthful state
2255  Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured.
2256    But thence I learn and find the lesson true,
2257    Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you.
2258
2259
2260                     119
2261  What potions have I drunk of Siren tears
2262  Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within,
2263  Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,
2264  Still losing when I saw my self to win!
2265  What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
2266  Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never!
2267  How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
2268  In the distraction of this madding fever!
2269  O benefit of ill, now I find true
2270  That better is, by evil still made better.
2271  And ruined love when it is built anew  
2272  Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
2273    So I return rebuked to my content,
2274    And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.
2275
2276
2277                     120
2278  That you were once unkind befriends me now,
2279  And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,
2280  Needs must I under my transgression bow,
2281  Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.
2282  For if you were by my unkindness shaken
2283  As I by yours, y'have passed a hell of time,
2284  And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
2285  To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.
2286  O that our night of woe might have remembered
2287  My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
2288  And soon to you, as you to me then tendered
2289  The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!
2290    But that your trespass now becomes a fee,
2291    Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.
2292
2293  
2294                     121
2295  'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,
2296  When not to be, receives reproach of being,
2297  And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed,
2298  Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing.
2299  For why should others' false adulterate eyes
2300  Give salutation to my sportive blood?
2301  Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
2302  Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
2303  No, I am that I am, and they that level
2304  At my abuses, reckon up their own,
2305  I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
2306  By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown
2307    Unless this general evil they maintain,
2308    All men are bad and in their badness reign.
2309
2310
2311                     122
2312  Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
2313  Full charactered with lasting memory,
2314  Which shall above that idle rank remain  
2315  Beyond all date even to eternity.
2316  Or at the least, so long as brain and heart
2317  Have faculty by nature to subsist,
2318  Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
2319  Of thee, thy record never can be missed:
2320  That poor retention could not so much hold,
2321  Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score,
2322  Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
2323  To trust those tables that receive thee more:
2324    To keep an adjunct to remember thee
2325    Were to import forgetfulness in me.
2326
2327
2328                     123
2329  No! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change,
2330  Thy pyramids built up with newer might
2331  To me are nothing novel, nothing strange,
2332  They are but dressings Of a former sight:
2333  Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire,
2334  What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
2335  And rather make them born to our desire,  
2336  Than think that we before have heard them told:
2337  Thy registers and thee I both defy,
2338  Not wond'ring at the present, nor the past,
2339  For thy records, and what we see doth lie,
2340  Made more or less by thy continual haste:
2341    This I do vow and this shall ever be,
2342    I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.
2343
2344
2345                     124
2346  If my dear love were but the child of state,
2347  It might for Fortune's bastard be unfathered,
2348  As subject to time's love or to time's hate,
2349  Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.
2350  No it was builded far from accident,
2351  It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
2352  Under the blow of thralled discontent,
2353  Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:
2354  It fears not policy that heretic,
2355  Which works on leases of short-numbered hours,
2356  But all alone stands hugely politic,  
2357  That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.
2358    To this I witness call the fools of time,
2359    Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.
2360
2361
2362                     125
2363  Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,
2364  With my extern the outward honouring,
2365  Or laid great bases for eternity,
2366  Which proves more short than waste or ruining?
2367  Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
2368  Lose all, and more by paying too much rent
2369  For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
2370  Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent?
2371  No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,
2372  And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
2373  Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,
2374  But mutual render, only me for thee.
2375    Hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul
2376    When most impeached, stands least in thy control.
2377
2378  
2379                     126
2380  O thou my lovely boy who in thy power,
2381  Dost hold Time's fickle glass his fickle hour:
2382  Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st,
2383  Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.
2384  If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)
2385  As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,
2386  She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
2387  May time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.
2388  Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,
2389  She may detain, but not still keep her treasure!
2390    Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,
2391    And her quietus is to render thee.
2392
2393
2394                     127
2395  In the old age black was not counted fair,
2396  Or if it were it bore not beauty's name:
2397  But now is black beauty's successive heir,
2398  And beauty slandered with a bastard shame,
2399  For since each hand hath put on nature's power,  
2400  Fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face,
2401  Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower,
2402  But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.
2403  Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
2404  Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem,
2405  At such who not born fair no beauty lack,
2406  Slandering creation with a false esteem,
2407    Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,
2408    That every tongue says beauty should look so.
2409
2410
2411                     128
2412  How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,
2413  Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
2414  With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
2415  The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
2416  Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,
2417  To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
2418  Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,
2419  At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand.
2420  To be so tickled they would change their state  
2421  And situation with those dancing chips,
2422  O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
2423  Making dead wood more blest than living lips,
2424    Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
2425    Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
2426
2427
2428                     129
2429  Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame
2430  Is lust in action, and till action, lust
2431  Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody full of blame,
2432  Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,
2433  Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,
2434  Past reason hunted, and no sooner had
2435  Past reason hated as a swallowed bait,
2436  On purpose laid to make the taker mad.
2437  Mad in pursuit and in possession so,
2438  Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme,
2439  A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,
2440  Before a joy proposed behind a dream.
2441    All this the world well knows yet none knows well,  
2442    To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.
2443
2444
2445                     130
2446  My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,
2447  Coral is far more red, than her lips red,
2448  If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun:
2449  If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head:
2450  I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
2451  But no such roses see I in her cheeks,
2452  And in some perfumes is there more delight,
2453  Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
2454  I love to hear her speak, yet well I know,
2455  That music hath a far more pleasing sound:
2456  I grant I never saw a goddess go,
2457  My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
2458    And yet by heaven I think my love as rare,
2459    As any she belied with false compare.
2460
2461
2462                     131
2463  Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,  
2464  As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
2465  For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
2466  Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
2467  Yet in good faith some say that thee behold,
2468  Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
2469  To say they err, I dare not be so bold,
2470  Although I swear it to my self alone.
2471  And to be sure that is not false I swear,
2472  A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,
2473  One on another's neck do witness bear
2474  Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.
2475    In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
2476    And thence this slander as I think proceeds.
2477
2478
2479                     132
2480  Thine eyes I love, and they as pitying me,
2481  Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
2482  Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
2483  Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
2484  And truly not the morning sun of heaven  
2485  Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,
2486  Nor that full star that ushers in the even
2487  Doth half that glory to the sober west
2488  As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
2489  O let it then as well beseem thy heart
2490  To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,
2491  And suit thy pity like in every part.
2492    Then will I swear beauty herself is black,
2493    And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
2494
2495
2496                     133
2497  Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
2498  For that deep wound it gives my friend and me;
2499  Is't not enough to torture me alone,
2500  But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
2501  Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken,
2502  And my next self thou harder hast engrossed,
2503  Of him, my self, and thee I am forsaken,
2504  A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:
2505  Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,  
2506  But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail,
2507  Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard,
2508  Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol.
2509    And yet thou wilt, for I being pent in thee,
2510    Perforce am thine and all that is in me.
2511
2512
2513                     134
2514  So now I have confessed that he is thine,
2515  And I my self am mortgaged to thy will,
2516  My self I'll forfeit, so that other mine,
2517  Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:
2518  But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
2519  For thou art covetous, and he is kind,
2520  He learned but surety-like to write for me,
2521  Under that bond that him as fist doth bind.
2522  The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
2523  Thou usurer that put'st forth all to use,
2524  And sue a friend, came debtor for my sake,
2525  So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
2526    Him have I lost, thou hast both him and me,  
2527    He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.
2528
2529
2530                     135
2531  Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
2532  And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus,
2533  More than enough am I that vex thee still,
2534  To thy sweet will making addition thus.
2535  Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious,
2536  Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
2537  Shall will in others seem right gracious,
2538  And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
2539  The sea all water, yet receives rain still,
2540  And in abundance addeth to his store,
2541  So thou being rich in will add to thy will
2542  One will of mine to make thy large will more.
2543    Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill,
2544    Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'
2545
2546
2547                     136
2548  If thy soul check thee that I come so near,  
2549  Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will',
2550  And will thy soul knows is admitted there,
2551  Thus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil.
2552  'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
2553  Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one,
2554  In things of great receipt with case we prove,
2555  Among a number one is reckoned none.
2556  Then in the number let me pass untold,
2557  Though in thy store's account I one must be,
2558  For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold,
2559  That nothing me, a something sweet to thee.
2560    Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
2561    And then thou lov'st me for my name is Will.
2562
2563
2564                     137
2565  Thou blind fool Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
2566  That they behold and see not what they see?
2567  They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
2568  Yet what the best is, take the worst to be.
2569  If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks,  
2570  Be anchored in the bay where all men ride,
2571  Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
2572  Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
2573  Why should my heart think that a several plot,
2574  Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
2575  Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not
2576  To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
2577    In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
2578    And to this false plague are they now transferred.
2579
2580
2581                     138
2582  When my love swears that she is made of truth,
2583  I do believe her though I know she lies,
2584  That she might think me some untutored youth,
2585  Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
2586  Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
2587  Although she knows my days are past the best,
2588  Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue,
2589  On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:
2590  But wherefore says she not she is unjust?  
2591  And wherefore say not I that I am old?
2592  O love's best habit is in seeming trust,
2593  And age in love, loves not to have years told.
2594    Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,
2595    And in our faults by lies we flattered be.
2596
2597
2598                     139
2599  O call not me to justify the wrong,
2600  That thy unkindness lays upon my heart,
2601  Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue,
2602  Use power with power, and slay me not by art,
2603  Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,
2604  Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside,
2605  What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
2606  Is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide?
2607  Let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows,
2608  Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,
2609  And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
2610  That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
2611    Yet do not so, but since I am near slain,  
2612    Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.
2613
2614
2615                     140
2616  Be wise as thou art cruel, do not press
2617  My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain:
2618  Lest sorrow lend me words and words express,
2619  The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
2620  If I might teach thee wit better it were,
2621  Though not to love, yet love to tell me so,
2622  As testy sick men when their deaths be near,
2623  No news but health from their physicians know.
2624  For if I should despair I should grow mad,
2625  And in my madness might speak ill of thee,
2626  Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
2627  Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.
2628    That I may not be so, nor thou belied,
2629    Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.
2630
2631
2632                     141
2633  In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,  
2634  For they in thee a thousand errors note,
2635  But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
2636  Who in despite of view is pleased to dote.
2637  Nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted,
2638  Nor tender feeling to base touches prone,
2639  Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
2640  To any sensual feast with thee alone:
2641  But my five wits, nor my five senses can
2642  Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
2643  Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,
2644  Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:
2645    Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
2646    That she that makes me sin, awards me pain.
2647
2648
2649                     142
2650  Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
2651  Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving,
2652  O but with mine, compare thou thine own state,
2653  And thou shalt find it merits not reproving,
2654  Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,  
2655  That have profaned their scarlet ornaments,
2656  And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,
2657  Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents.
2658  Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those,
2659  Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee,
2660  Root pity in thy heart that when it grows,
2661  Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
2662    If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
2663    By self-example mayst thou be denied.
2664
2665
2666                     143
2667  Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch,
2668  One of her feathered creatures broke away,
2669  Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
2670  In pursuit of the thing she would have stay:
2671  Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
2672  Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent,
2673  To follow that which flies before her face:
2674  Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
2675  So run'st thou after that which flies from thee,  
2676  Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind,
2677  But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me:
2678  And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind.
2679    So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,
2680    If thou turn back and my loud crying still.
2681
2682
2683                     144
2684  Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
2685  Which like two spirits do suggest me still,
2686  The better angel is a man right fair:
2687  The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.
2688  To win me soon to hell my female evil,
2689  Tempteth my better angel from my side,
2690  And would corrupt my saint to be a devil:
2691  Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
2692  And whether that my angel be turned fiend,
2693  Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,
2694  But being both from me both to each friend,
2695  I guess one angel in another's hell.
2696    Yet this shall I ne'er know but live in doubt,  
2697    Till my bad angel fire my good one out.
2698
2699
2700                     145
2701  Those lips that Love's own hand did make,
2702  Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',
2703  To me that languished for her sake:
2704  But when she saw my woeful state,
2705  Straight in her heart did mercy come,
2706  Chiding that tongue that ever sweet,
2707  Was used in giving gentle doom:
2708  And taught it thus anew to greet:
2709  'I hate' she altered with an end,
2710  That followed it as gentle day,
2711  Doth follow night who like a fiend
2712  From heaven to hell is flown away.
2713    'I hate', from hate away she threw,
2714    And saved my life saying 'not you'.
2715
2716
2717                     146
2718  Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth,  
2719  My sinful earth these rebel powers array,
2720  Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
2721  Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
2722  Why so large cost having so short a lease,
2723  Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
2724  Shall worms inheritors of this excess
2725  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
2726  Then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss,
2727  And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
2728  Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
2729  Within be fed, without be rich no more,
2730    So shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men,
2731    And death once dead, there's no more dying then.
2732
2733
2734                     147
2735  My love is as a fever longing still,
2736  For that which longer nurseth the disease,
2737  Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
2738  Th' uncertain sickly appetite to please:
2739  My reason the physician to my love,  
2740  Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
2741  Hath left me, and I desperate now approve,
2742  Desire is death, which physic did except.
2743  Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
2744  And frantic-mad with evermore unrest,
2745  My thoughts and my discourse as mad men's are,
2746  At random from the truth vainly expressed.
2747    For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
2748    Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.
2749
2750
2751                     148
2752  O me! what eyes hath love put in my head,
2753  Which have no correspondence with true sight,
2754  Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
2755  That censures falsely what they see aright?
2756  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
2757  What means the world to say it is not so?
2758  If it be not, then love doth well denote,
2759  Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,
2760  How can it? O how can love's eye be true,  
2761  That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
2762  No marvel then though I mistake my view,
2763  The sun it self sees not, till heaven clears.
2764    O cunning love, with tears thou keep'st me blind,
2765    Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.
2766
2767
2768                     149
2769  Canst thou O cruel, say I love thee not,
2770  When I against my self with thee partake?
2771  Do I not think on thee when I forgot
2772  Am of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake?
2773  Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,
2774  On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,
2775  Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not spend
2776  Revenge upon my self with present moan?
2777  What merit do I in my self respect,
2778  That is so proud thy service to despise,
2779  When all my best doth worship thy defect,
2780  Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
2781    But love hate on for now I know thy mind,  
2782    Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.
2783
2784
2785                     150
2786  O from what power hast thou this powerful might,
2787  With insufficiency my heart to sway,
2788  To make me give the lie to my true sight,
2789  And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
2790  Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
2791  That in the very refuse of thy deeds,
2792  There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
2793  That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?
2794  Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
2795  The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
2796  O though I love what others do abhor,
2797  With others thou shouldst not abhor my state.
2798    If thy unworthiness raised love in me,
2799    More worthy I to be beloved of thee.
2800
2801
2802                     151
2803  Love is too young to know what conscience is,  
2804  Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
2805  Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss,
2806  Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.
2807  For thou betraying me, I do betray
2808  My nobler part to my gross body's treason,
2809  My soul doth tell my body that he may,
2810  Triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason,
2811  But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
2812  As his triumphant prize, proud of this pride,
2813  He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
2814  To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
2815    No want of conscience hold it that I call,
2816    Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.
2817
2818
2819                     152
2820  In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
2821  But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,
2822  In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,
2823  In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
2824  But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,  
2825  When I break twenty? I am perjured most,
2826  For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee:
2827  And all my honest faith in thee is lost.
2828  For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness:
2829  Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
2830  And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,
2831  Or made them swear against the thing they see.
2832    For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured I,
2833    To swear against the truth so foul a be.
2834
2835
2836                     153
2837  Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep,
2838  A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
2839  And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
2840  In a cold valley-fountain of that ground:
2841  Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,
2842  A dateless lively heat still to endure,
2843  And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove,
2844  Against strange maladies a sovereign cure:
2845  But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,  
2846  The boy for trial needs would touch my breast,
2847  I sick withal the help of bath desired,
2848  And thither hied a sad distempered guest.
2849    But found no cure, the bath for my help lies,
2850    Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.
2851
2852
2853                     154
2854  The little Love-god lying once asleep,
2855  Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
2856  Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,
2857  Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand,
2858  The fairest votary took up that fire,
2859  Which many legions of true hearts had warmed,
2860  And so the general of hot desire,
2861  Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.
2862  This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
2863  Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
2864  Growing a bath and healthful remedy,
2865  For men discased, but I my mistress' thrall,
2866    Came there for cure and this by that I prove,  
2867    Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.

2936ACT I. SCENE 1.
2937Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace
2938
2939Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black
2940
2941  COUNTESS. In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
2942  BERTRAM. And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew;
2943    but I must attend his Majesty's command, to whom I am now in
2944    ward, evermore in subjection.
2945  LAFEU. You shall find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a
2946    father. He that so generally is at all times good must of
2947    necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it
2948    up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such
2949    abundance.
2950  COUNTESS. What hope is there of his Majesty's amendment?
2951  LAFEU. He hath abandon'd his physicians, madam; under whose
2952    practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other
2953    advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.
2954  COUNTESS. This young gentlewoman had a father- O, that 'had,' how
2955    sad a passage 'tis!-whose skill was almost as great as his
2956    honesty; had it stretch'd so far, would have made nature  
2957    immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for
2958    the King's sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of
2959    the King's disease.
2960  LAFEU. How call'd you the man you speak of, madam?
2961  COUNTESS. He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his
2962    great right to be so- Gerard de Narbon.
2963  LAFEU. He was excellent indeed, madam; the King very lately spoke
2964    of him admiringly and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have
2965    liv'd still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.
2966  BERTRAM. What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?
2967  LAFEU. A fistula, my lord.
2968  BERTRAM. I heard not of it before.
2969  LAFEU. I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the
2970    daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
2971  COUNTESS. His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
2972    overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education
2973    promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts
2974    fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities,
2975    there commendations go with pity-they are virtues and traitors
2976    too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives  
2977    her honesty, and achieves her goodness.
2978  LAFEU. Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
2979  COUNTESS. 'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in.
2980    The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the
2981    tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No
2982    more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather thought
2983    you affect a sorrow than to have-
2984  HELENA. I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
2985  LAFEU. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead: excessive
2986    grief the enemy to the living.
2987  COUNTESS. If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it
2988    soon mortal.
2989  BERTRAM. Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
2990  LAFEU. How understand we that?
2991  COUNTESS. Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
2992    In manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue
2993    Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
2994    Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
2995    Do wrong to none; be able for thine enemy
2996    Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend  
2997    Under thy own life's key; be check'd for silence,
2998    But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
2999    That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down,
3000    Fall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,
3001    'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
3002    Advise him.
3003  LAFEU. He cannot want the best
3004    That shall attend his love.
3005  COUNTESS. Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.            Exit
3006  BERTRAM. The best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoughts be
3007    servants to you!  [To HELENA]  Be comfortable to my mother, your
3008    mistress, and make much of her.
3009  LAFEU. Farewell, pretty lady; you must hold the credit of your
3010    father.                             Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU
3011  HELENA. O, were that all! I think not on my father;
3012    And these great tears grace his remembrance more
3013    Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
3014    I have forgot him; my imagination
3015    Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
3016    I am undone; there is no living, none,  
3017    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
3018    That I should love a bright particular star
3019    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
3020    In his bright radiance and collateral light
3021    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
3022    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
3023    The hind that would be mated by the lion
3024    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
3025    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
3026    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
3027    In our heart's table-heart too capable
3028    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
3029    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
3030    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?
3031
3032                       Enter PAROLLES
3033
3034    [Aside]  One that goes with him. I love him for his sake;
3035    And yet I know him a notorious liar,
3036    Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;  
3037    Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him
3038    That they take place when virtue's steely bones
3039    Looks bleak i' th' cold wind; withal, full oft we see
3040    Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
3041  PAROLLES. Save you, fair queen!
3042  HELENA. And you, monarch!
3043  PAROLLES. No.
3044  HELENA. And no.
3045  PAROLLES. Are you meditating on virginity?
3046  HELENA. Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a
3047    question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it
3048    against him?
3049  PAROLLES. Keep him out.
3050  HELENA. But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant in the
3051    defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.
3052  PAROLLES. There is none. Man, setting down before you, will
3053    undermine you and blow you up.
3054  HELENA. Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up!
3055    Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men?
3056  PAROLLES. Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown  
3057    up; marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves
3058     made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth
3059    of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
3060    increase; and there was never virgin got till virginity was first
3061    lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity
3062    by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it
3063    is ever lost. 'Tis too cold a companion; away with't.
3064  HELENA. I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a
3065    virgin.
3066  PAROLLES. There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule
3067    of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your
3068    mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs
3069    himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself, and should be
3070    buried in highways, out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
3071    offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a
3072    cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with
3073    feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud,
3074    idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
3075    canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by't. Out with't.
3076    Within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly  
3077    increase; and the principal itself not much the worse. Away
3078    with't.
3079  HELENA. How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
3080  PAROLLES. Let me see. Marry, ill to like him that ne'er it likes.
3081    'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept,
3082    the less worth. Off with't while 'tis vendible; answer the time
3083    of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of
3084    fashion, richly suited but unsuitable; just like the brooch and
3085    the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your
3086    pie and your porridge than in your cheek. And your virginity,
3087    your old virginity, is like one of our French wither'd pears: it
3088    looks ill, it eats drily; marry, 'tis a wither'd pear; it was
3089    formerly better; marry, yet 'tis a wither'd pear. Will you
3090    anything with it?
3091  HELENA. Not my virginity yet.
3092    There shall your master have a thousand loves,
3093    A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,
3094    A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,
3095    A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
3096    A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;  
3097    His humble ambition, proud humility,
3098    His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
3099    His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
3100    Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms
3101    That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he-
3102    I know not what he shall. God send him well!
3103    The court's a learning-place, and he is one-
3104  PAROLLES. What one, i' faith?
3105  HELENA. That I wish well. 'Tis pity-
3106  PAROLLES. What's pity?
3107  HELENA. That wishing well had not a body in't
3108    Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
3109    Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
3110    Might with effects of them follow our friends
3111    And show what we alone must think, which never
3112    Returns us thanks.
3113
3114                      Enter PAGE
3115
3116  PAGE. Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.      Exit PAGE  
3117  PAROLLES. Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I will
3118    think of thee at court.
3119  HELENA. Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
3120  PAROLLES. Under Mars, I.
3121  HELENA. I especially think, under Mars.
3122  PAROLLES. Why under Man?
3123  HELENA. The wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born
3124    under Mars.
3125  PAROLLES. When he was predominant.
3126  HELENA. When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
3127  PAROLLES. Why think you so?
3128  HELENA. You go so much backward when you fight.
3129  PAROLLES. That's for advantage.
3130  HELENA. So is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the
3131    composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of
3132    a good wing, and I like the wear well.
3133  PAROLLES. I am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely. I
3134    will return perfect courtier; in the which my instruction shall
3135    serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
3136    counsel, and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else  
3137    thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes
3138    thee away. Farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers;
3139    when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good
3140    husband and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell.
3141 Exit
3142  HELENA. Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
3143    Which we ascribe to heaven. The fated sky
3144    Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull
3145    Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
3146    What power is it which mounts my love so high,
3147    That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
3148    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
3149    To join like likes, and kiss like native things.
3150    Impossible be strange attempts to those
3151    That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose
3152    What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove
3153    To show her merit that did miss her love?
3154    The King's disease-my project may deceive me,
3155    But my intents are fix'd, and will not leave me.        Exit

3160ACT I. SCENE 2.
3161Paris. The KING'S palace
3162
3163Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING OF FRANCE, with letters,
3164and divers ATTENDANTS
3165
3166  KING. The Florentines and Senoys are by th' ears;
3167    Have fought with equal fortune, and continue
3168    A braving war.
3169  FIRST LORD. So 'tis reported, sir.
3170  KING. Nay, 'tis most credible. We here receive it,
3171    A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
3172    With caution, that the Florentine will move us
3173    For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
3174    Prejudicates the business, and would seem
3175    To have us make denial.
3176  FIRST LORD. His love and wisdom,
3177    Approv'd so to your Majesty, may plead
3178    For amplest credence.
3179  KING. He hath arm'd our answer,
3180    And Florence is denied before he comes;
3181    Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see  
3182    The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
3183    To stand on either part.
3184  SECOND LORD. It well may serve
3185    A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
3186    For breathing and exploit.
3187  KING. What's he comes here?
3188
3189              Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES
3190
3191  FIRST LORD. It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
3192    Young Bertram.
3193  KING. Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
3194    Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
3195    Hath well compos'd thee. Thy father's moral parts
3196    Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
3197  BERTRAM. My thanks and duty are your Majesty's.
3198  KING. I would I had that corporal soundness now,
3199    As when thy father and myself in friendship
3200    First tried our soldiership. He did look far
3201    Into the service of the time, and was  
3202    Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long;
3203    But on us both did haggish age steal on,
3204    And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
3205    To talk of your good father. In his youth
3206    He had the wit which I can well observe
3207    To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
3208    Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
3209    Ere they can hide their levity in honour.
3210    So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
3211    Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
3212    His equal had awak'd them; and his honour,
3213    Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
3214    Exception bid him speak, and at this time
3215    His tongue obey'd his hand. Who were below him
3216    He us'd as creatures of another place;
3217    And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
3218    Making them proud of his humility
3219    In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
3220    Might be a copy to these younger times;
3221    Which, followed well, would demonstrate them now  
3222    But goers backward.
3223  BERTRAM. His good remembrance, sir,
3224    Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
3225    So in approof lives not his epitaph
3226    As in your royal speech.
3227  KING. Would I were with him! He would always say-
3228    Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
3229    He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them
3230    To grow there, and to bear- 'Let me not live'-
3231    This his good melancholy oft began,
3232    On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
3233    When it was out-'Let me not live' quoth he
3234    'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
3235    Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
3236    All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
3237    Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
3238    Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd.
3239    I, after him, do after him wish too,
3240    Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
3241    I quickly were dissolved from my hive,  
3242    To give some labourers room.
3243  SECOND LORD. You're loved, sir;
3244    They that least lend it you shall lack you first.
3245  KING. I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, Count,
3246    Since the physician at your father's died?
3247    He was much fam'd.
3248  BERTRAM. Some six months since, my lord.
3249  KING. If he were living, I would try him yet-
3250    Lend me an arm-the rest have worn me out
3251    With several applications. Nature and sickness
3252    Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count;
3253    My son's no dearer.
3254  BERTRAM. Thank your Majesty.                 Exeunt [Flourish]

3259ACT I. SCENE 3.
3260Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace
3261
3262Enter COUNTESS, STEWARD, and CLOWN
3263
3264  COUNTESS. I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?
3265  STEWARD. Madam, the care I have had to even your content I wish
3266    might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we
3267    wound our modesty, and make foul the clearness of our deservings,
3268    when of ourselves we publish them.
3269  COUNTESS. What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The
3270    complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe; 'tis my
3271    slowness that I do not, for I know you lack not folly to commit
3272    them and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.
3273  CLOWN. 'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.
3274  COUNTESS. Well, sir.
3275  CLOWN. No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though many of
3276    the rich are damn'd; but if I may have your ladyship's good will
3277    to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.
3278  COUNTESS. Wilt thou needs be a beggar?
3279  CLOWN. I do beg your good will in this case.
3280  COUNTESS. In what case?  
3281  CLOWN. In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no heritage; and I
3282    think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o'
3283    my body; for they say bames are blessings.
3284  COUNTESS. Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
3285  CLOWN. My poor body, madam, requires it. I am driven on by the
3286    flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.
3287  COUNTESS. Is this all your worship's reason?
3288  CLOWN. Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.
3289  COUNTESS. May the world know them?
3290  CLOWN. I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh
3291    and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent.
3292  COUNTESS. Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.
3293  CLOWN. I am out o' friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for
3294    my wife's sake.
3295  COUNTESS. Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
3296  CLOWN. Y'are shallow, madam-in great friends; for the knaves come
3297    to do that for me which I am aweary of. He that ears my land
3298    spares my team, and gives me leave to in the crop. If I be his
3299    cuckold, he's my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the
3300    cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and  
3301    blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood
3302    is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men
3303    could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in
3304    marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the
3305    papist, howsome'er their hearts are sever'd in religion, their
3306    heads are both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer
3307    i' th' herd.
3308  COUNTESS. Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouth'd and calumnious knave?
3309  CLOWN. A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:
3310
3311              For I the ballad will repeat,
3312                Which men full true shall find:
3313              Your marriage comes by destiny,
3314                Your cuckoo sings by kind.
3315
3316  COUNTESS. Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.
3317  STEWARD. May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you.
3318    Of her I am to speak.
3319  COUNTESS. Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen
3320    I mean.  
3321  CLOWN.  [Sings]
3322
3323               'Was this fair face the cause' quoth she
3324                 'Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
3325               Fond done, done fond,
3326                 Was this King Priam's joy?'
3327               With that she sighed as she stood,
3328               With that she sighed as she stood,
3329                 And gave this sentence then:
3330               'Among nine bad if one be good,
3331               Among nine bad if one be good,
3332                 There's yet one good in ten.'
3333
3334  COUNTESS. What, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.
3335  CLOWN. One good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o' th'
3336    song. Would God would serve the world so all the year! We'd find
3337    no fault with the tithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten,
3338    quoth 'a! An we might have a good woman born before every blazing
3339    star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery well: a man
3340    may draw his heart out ere 'a pluck one.
3341  COUNTESS. You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.  
3342  CLOWN. That man should be at woman's command, and yet no hurt done!
3343    Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will
3344    wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart.
3345    I am going, forsooth. The business is for Helen to come hither.
3346 Exit
3347  COUNTESS. Well, now.
3348  STEWARD. I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.
3349  COUNTESS. Faith I do. Her father bequeath'd her to me; and she
3350    herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as
3351    much love as she finds. There is more owing her than is paid; and
3352    more shall be paid her than she'll demand.
3353  STEWARD. Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she
3354    wish'd me. Alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own
3355    words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they
3356    touch'd not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your
3357    son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such
3358    difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not
3359    extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana no queen
3360    of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris'd without
3361    rescue in the first assault, or ransom afterward. This she  
3362    deliver'd in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er I heard
3363    virgin exclaim in; which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you
3364    withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you
3365    something to know it.
3366  COUNTESS. YOU have discharg'd this honestly; keep it to yourself.
3367    Many likelihoods inform'd me of this before, which hung so
3368    tott'ring in the balance that I could neither believe nor
3369    misdoubt. Pray you leave me. Stall this in your bosom; and I
3370    thank you for your honest care. I will speak with you further
3371    anon.                                           Exit STEWARD
3372
3373                            Enter HELENA
3374
3375    Even so it was with me when I was young.
3376    If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn
3377    Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;
3378    Our blood to us, this to our blood is born.
3379    It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
3380    Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth.
3381    By our remembrances of days foregone,  
3382    Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
3383    Her eye is sick on't; I observe her now.
3384  HELENA. What is your pleasure, madam?
3385  COUNTESS. You know, Helen,
3386    I am a mother to you.
3387  HELENA. Mine honourable mistress.
3388  COUNTESS. Nay, a mother.
3389    Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'
3390    Methought you saw a serpent. What's in 'mother'
3391    That you start at it? I say I am your mother,
3392    And put you in the catalogue of those
3393    That were enwombed mine. 'Tis often seen
3394    Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds
3395    A native slip to us from foreign seeds.
3396    You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,
3397    Yet I express to you a mother's care.
3398    God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
3399    To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,
3400    That this distempered messenger of wet,
3401    The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?  
3402    Why, that you are my daughter?
3403  HELENA. That I am not.
3404  COUNTESS. I say I am your mother.
3405  HELENA. Pardon, madam.
3406    The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:
3407    I am from humble, he from honoured name;
3408    No note upon my parents, his all noble.
3409    My master, my dear lord he is; and I
3410    His servant live, and will his vassal die.
3411    He must not be my brother.
3412  COUNTESS. Nor I your mother?
3413  HELENA. You are my mother, madam; would you were-
3414    So that my lord your son were not my brother-
3415    Indeed my mother! Or were you both our mothers,
3416    I care no more for than I do for heaven,
3417    So I were not his sister. Can't no other,
3418    But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?
3419  COUNTESS. Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.
3420    God shield you mean it not! 'daughter' and 'mother'
3421    So strive upon your pulse. What! pale again?  
3422    My fear hath catch'd your fondness. Now I see
3423    The myst'ry of your loneliness, and find
3424    Your salt tears' head. Now to all sense 'tis gross
3425    You love my son; invention is asham'd,
3426    Against the proclamation of thy passion,
3427    To say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true;
3428    But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look, thy cheeks
3429    Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes
3430    See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours
3431    That in their kind they speak it; only sin
3432    And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
3433    That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?
3434    If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
3435    If it be not, forswear't; howe'er, I charge thee,
3436    As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
3437    To tell me truly.
3438  HELENA. Good madam, pardon me.
3439  COUNTESS. Do you love my son?
3440  HELENA. Your pardon, noble mistress.
3441  COUNTESS. Love you my son?  
3442  HELENA. Do not you love him, madam?
3443  COUNTESS. Go not about; my love hath in't a bond
3444    Whereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose
3445    The state of your affection; for your passions
3446    Have to the full appeach'd.
3447  HELENA. Then I confess,
3448    Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,
3449    That before you, and next unto high heaven,
3450    I love your son.
3451    My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love.
3452    Be not offended, for it hurts not him
3453    That he is lov'd of me; I follow him not
3454    By any token of presumptuous suit,
3455    Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
3456    Yet never know how that desert should be.
3457    I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
3458    Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
3459    I still pour in the waters of my love,
3460    And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,
3461    Religious in mine error, I adore  
3462    The sun that looks upon his worshipper
3463    But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
3464    Let not your hate encounter with my love,
3465    For loving where you do; but if yourself,
3466    Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
3467    Did ever in so true a flame of liking
3468    Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian
3469    Was both herself and Love; O, then, give pity
3470    To her whose state is such that cannot choose
3471    But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
3472    That seeks not to find that her search implies,
3473    But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!
3474  COUNTESS. Had you not lately an intent-speak truly-
3475    To go to Paris?
3476  HELENA. Madam, I had.
3477  COUNTESS. Wherefore? Tell true.
3478  HELENA. I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
3479    You know my father left me some prescriptions
3480    Of rare and prov'd effects, such as his reading
3481    And manifest experience had collected  
3482    For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me
3483    In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,
3484    As notes whose faculties inclusive were
3485    More than they were in note. Amongst the rest
3486    There is a remedy, approv'd, set down,
3487    To cure the desperate languishings whereof
3488    The King is render'd lost.
3489  COUNTESS. This was your motive
3490    For Paris, was it? Speak.
3491  HELENA. My lord your son made me to think of this,
3492    Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King,
3493    Had from the conversation of my thoughts
3494    Haply been absent then.
3495  COUNTESS. But think you, Helen,
3496    If you should tender your supposed aid,
3497    He would receive it? He and his physicians
3498    Are of a mind: he, that they cannot help him;
3499    They, that they cannot help. How shall they credit
3500    A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
3501    Embowell'd of their doctrine, have let off  
3502    The danger to itself?
3503  HELENA. There's something in't
3504    More than my father's skill, which was the great'st
3505    Of his profession, that his good receipt
3506    Shall for my legacy be sanctified
3507    By th' luckiest stars in heaven; and, would your honour
3508    But give me leave to try success, I'd venture
3509    The well-lost life of mine on his Grace's cure.
3510    By such a day and hour.
3511  COUNTESS. Dost thou believe't?
3512  HELENA. Ay, madam, knowingly.
3513  COUNTESS. Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
3514    Means and attendants, and my loving greetings
3515    To those of mine in court. I'll stay at home,
3516    And pray God's blessing into thy attempt.
3517    Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,
3518    What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.          Exeunt

3534ACT II. SCENE 1.
3535Paris. The KING'S palace
3536
3537Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING with divers young LORDS taking leave
3538for the Florentine war; BERTRAM and PAROLLES; ATTENDANTS
3539
3540  KING. Farewell, young lords; these war-like principles
3541    Do not throw from you. And you, my lords, farewell;
3542    Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain all,
3543    The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis receiv'd,
3544    And is enough for both.
3545  FIRST LORD. 'Tis our hope, sir,
3546    After well-ent'red soldiers, to return
3547    And find your Grace in health.
3548  KING. No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
3549    Will not confess he owes the malady
3550    That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;
3551    Whether I live or die, be you the sons
3552    Of worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy-
3553    Those bated that inherit but the fall
3554    Of the last monarchy-see that you come  
3555    Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
3556    The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
3557    That fame may cry you aloud. I say farewell.
3558  SECOND LORD. Health, at your bidding, serve your Majesty!
3559  KING. Those girls of Italy, take heed of them;
3560    They say our French lack language to deny,
3561    If they demand; beware of being captives
3562    Before you serve.
3563    BOTH. Our hearts receive your warnings.
3564  KING. Farewell.  [To ATTENDANTS]  Come hither to me.
3565                                       The KING retires attended
3566  FIRST LORD. O my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!
3567  PAROLLES. 'Tis not his fault, the spark.
3568    SECOND LORD. O, 'tis brave wars!
3569  PAROLLES. Most admirable! I have seen those wars.
3570  BERTRAM. I am commanded here and kept a coil with
3571    'Too young' and next year' and "Tis too early.'
3572  PAROLLES. An thy mind stand to 't, boy, steal away bravely.
3573  BERTRAM. I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
3574    Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,  
3575    Till honour be bought up, and no sword worn
3576    But one to dance with. By heaven, I'll steal away.
3577  FIRST LORD. There's honour in the theft.
3578  PAROLLES. Commit it, Count.
3579  SECOND LORD. I am your accessary; and so farewell.
3580  BERTRAM. I grow to you, and our parting is a tortur'd body.
3581  FIRST LORD. Farewell, Captain.
3582  SECOND LORD. Sweet Monsieur Parolles!
3583  PAROLLES. Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and
3584    lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall find in the regiment of
3585    the Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of
3586    war, here on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword
3587    entrench'd it. Say to him I live; and observe his reports for me.
3588  FIRST LORD. We shall, noble Captain.
3589  PAROLLES. Mars dote on you for his novices!       Exeunt LORDS
3590    What will ye do?
3591
3592                            Re-enter the KING
3593
3594  BERTRAM. Stay; the King!  
3595  PAROLLES. Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have
3596    restrain'd yourself within the list of too cold an adieu. Be more
3597    expressive to them; for they wear themselves in the cap of the
3598    time; there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move, under the
3599    influence of the most receiv'd star; and though the devil lead
3600    the measure, such are to be followed. After them, and take a more
3601    dilated farewell.
3602  BERTRAM. And I will do so.
3603  PAROLLES. Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.
3604                                     Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES
3605
3606                              Enter LAFEU
3607
3608  LAFEU.  [Kneeling]  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.
3609  KING. I'll fee thee to stand up.
3610  LAFEU. Then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon.
3611    I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy;
3612    And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
3613  KING. I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
3614    And ask'd thee mercy for't.  
3615  LAFEU. Good faith, across!
3616    But, my good lord, 'tis thus: will you be cur'd
3617    Of your infirmity?
3618  KING. No.
3619  LAFEU. O, will you eat
3620    No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will
3621    My noble grapes, an if my royal fox
3622    Could reach them: I have seen a medicine
3623    That's able to breathe life into a stone,
3624    Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
3625    With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch
3626    Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
3627    To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand
3628    And write to her a love-line.
3629  KING. What her is this?
3630  LAFEU. Why, Doctor She! My lord, there's one arriv'd,
3631    If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour,
3632    If seriously I may convey my thoughts
3633    In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
3634    With one that in her sex, her years, profession,  
3635    Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz'd me more
3636    Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her,
3637    For that is her demand, and know her business?
3638    That done, laugh well at me.
3639  KING. Now, good Lafeu,
3640    Bring in the admiration, that we with the
3641    May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
3642    By wond'ring how thou took'st it.
3643  LAFEU. Nay, I'll fit you,
3644    And not be all day neither.                       Exit LAFEU
3645  KING. Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.
3646
3647                   Re-enter LAFEU with HELENA
3648
3649  LAFEU. Nay, come your ways.
3650  KING. This haste hath wings indeed.
3651  LAFEU. Nay, come your ways;
3652    This is his Majesty; say your mind to him.
3653    A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
3654    His Majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid's uncle,  
3655    That dare leave two together. Fare you well.            Exit
3656  KING. Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
3657  HELENA. Ay, my good lord.
3658    Gerard de Narbon was my father,
3659    In what he did profess, well found.
3660  KING. I knew him.
3661  HELENA. The rather will I spare my praises towards him;
3662    Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
3663    Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one,
3664    Which, as the dearest issue of his practice,
3665    And of his old experience th' only darling,
3666    He bade me store up as a triple eye,
3667    Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so:
3668    And, hearing your high Majesty is touch'd
3669    With that malignant cause wherein the honour
3670    Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
3671    I come to tender it, and my appliance,
3672    With all bound humbleness.
3673  KING. We thank you, maiden;
3674    But may not be so credulous of cure,  
3675    When our most learned doctors leave us, and
3676    The congregated college have concluded
3677    That labouring art can never ransom nature
3678    From her inaidable estate-I say we must not
3679    So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
3680    To prostitute our past-cure malady
3681    To empirics; or to dissever so
3682    Our great self and our credit to esteem
3683    A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.
3684  HELENA. My duty then shall pay me for my pains.
3685    I will no more enforce mine office on you;
3686    Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
3687    A modest one to bear me back again.
3688  KING. I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful.
3689    Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
3690    As one near death to those that wish him live.
3691    But what at full I know, thou know'st no part;
3692    I knowing all my peril, thou no art.
3693  HELENA. What I can do can do no hurt to try,
3694    Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.  
3695    He that of greatest works is finisher
3696    Oft does them by the weakest minister.
3697    So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
3698    When judges have been babes. Great floods have flown
3699    From simple sources, and great seas have dried
3700    When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
3701    Oft expectation fails, and most oft there
3702    Where most it promises; and oft it hits
3703    Where hope is coldest, and despair most fits.
3704  KING. I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid;
3705    Thy pains, not us'd, must by thyself be paid;
3706    Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
3707  HELENA. Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd.
3708    It is not so with Him that all things knows,
3709    As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;
3710    But most it is presumption in us when
3711    The help of heaven we count the act of men.
3712    Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
3713    Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
3714    I am not an impostor, that proclaim  
3715    Myself against the level of mine aim;
3716    But know I think, and think I know most sure,
3717    My art is not past power nor you past cure.
3718  KING. Art thou so confident? Within what space
3719    Hop'st thou my cure?
3720  HELENA. The greatest Grace lending grace.
3721    Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
3722    Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
3723    Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
3724    Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
3725    Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
3726    Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
3727    What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
3728    Health shall live free, and sickness freely die.
3729  KING. Upon thy certainty and confidence
3730    What dar'st thou venture?
3731  HELENA. Tax of impudence,
3732    A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame,
3733    Traduc'd by odious ballads; my maiden's name
3734    Sear'd otherwise; ne worse of worst-extended  
3735    With vilest torture let my life be ended.
3736  KING. Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
3737    His powerful sound within an organ weak;
3738    And what impossibility would slay
3739    In common sense, sense saves another way.
3740    Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
3741    Worth name of life in thee hath estimate:
3742    Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
3743    That happiness and prime can happy call.
3744    Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
3745    Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
3746    Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
3747    That ministers thine own death if I die.
3748  HELENA. If I break time, or flinch in property
3749    Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die;
3750    And well deserv'd. Not helping, death's my fee;
3751    But, if I help, what do you promise me?
3752  KING. Make thy demand.
3753  HELENA. But will you make it even?
3754  KING. Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.  
3755  HELENA. Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
3756    What husband in thy power I will command.
3757    Exempted be from me the arrogance
3758    To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
3759    My low and humble name to propagate
3760    With any branch or image of thy state;
3761    But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
3762    Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.
3763  KING. Here is my hand; the premises observ'd,
3764    Thy will by my performance shall be serv'd.
3765    So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
3766    Thy resolv'd patient, on thee still rely.
3767    More should I question thee, and more I must,
3768    Though more to know could not be more to trust,
3769    From whence thou cam'st, how tended on. But rest
3770    Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
3771    Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
3772    As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.
3773                                              [Flourish. Exeunt]

3779Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace
3780
3781Enter COUNTESS and CLOWN
3782
3783  COUNTESS. Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of your
3784    breeding.
3785  CLOWN. I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my
3786    business is but to the court.
3787  COUNTESS. To the court! Why, what place make you special, when you
3788    put off that with such contempt? But to the court!
3789  CLOWN. Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may
3790    easily put it off at court. He that cannot make a leg, put off's
3791    cap, kiss his hand, and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip,
3792    nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for
3793    the court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all men.
3794  COUNTESS. Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions.
3795  CLOWN. It is like a barber's chair, that fits all buttocks-the pin
3796    buttock, the quatch buttock, the brawn buttock, or any buttock.
3797  COUNTESS. Will your answer serve fit to all questions?
3798  CLOWN. As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your
3799    French crown for your taffety punk, as Tib's rush for Tom's
3800    forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove Tuesday, a morris for Mayday,
3801    as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding
3802    quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the friar's
3803    mouth; nay, as the pudding to his skin.
3804  COUNTESS. Have you, I, say, an answer of such fitness for all
3805    questions?
3806  CLOWN. From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit
3807    any question.
3808  COUNTESS. It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit
3809    all demands.
3810  CLOWN. But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should
3811    speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that belongs to't. Ask me
3812    if I am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn.
3813  COUNTESS. To be young again, if we could, I will be a fool in
3814    question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir,
3815    are you a courtier?
3816  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-There's a simple putting off. More, more, a
3817    hundred of them.
3818  COUNTESS. Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.
3819  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Thick, thick; spare not me.  
3820  COUNTESS. I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.
3821  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.
3822  COUNTESS. You were lately whipp'd, sir, as I think.
3823  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Spare not me.
3824  COUNTESS. Do you cry 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and 'spare
3825    not me'? Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very sequent to your
3826    whipping. You would answer very well to a whipping, if you were
3827    but bound to't.
3828  CLOWN. I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord, sir!' I see
3829    thing's may serve long, but not serve ever.
3830  COUNTESS. I play the noble housewife with the time,
3831    To entertain it so merrily with a fool.
3832  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Why, there't serves well again.
3833  COUNTESS. An end, sir! To your business: give Helen this,
3834    And urge her to a present answer back;
3835    Commend me to my kinsmen and my son. This is not much.
3836  CLOWN. Not much commendation to them?
3837  COUNTESS. Not much employment for you. You understand me?
3838  CLOWN. Most fruitfully; I am there before my legs.
3839  COUNTESS. Haste you again.                              Exeunt

3844ACT II. SCENE 3.
3845Paris. The KING'S palace
3846
3847Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES
3848
3849  LAFEU. They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical
3850    persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and
3851    causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors,
3852    ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit
3853    ourselves to an unknown fear.
3854  PAROLLES. Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot
3855    out in our latter times.
3856  BERTRAM. And so 'tis.
3857  LAFEU. To be relinquish'd of the artists-
3858  PAROLLES. So I say-both of Galen and Paracelsus.
3859  LAFEU. Of all the learned and authentic fellows-
3860  PAROLLES. Right; so I say.
3861  LAFEU. That gave him out incurable-
3862  PAROLLES. Why, there 'tis; so say I too.
3863  LAFEU. Not to be help'd-
3864  PAROLLES. Right; as 'twere a man assur'd of a-
3865  LAFEU. Uncertain life and sure death.  
3866  PAROLLES. Just; you say well; so would I have said.
3867  LAFEU. I may truly say it is a novelty to the world.
3868  PAROLLES. It is indeed. If you will have it in showing, you shall
3869    read it in what-do-ye-call't here.
3870  LAFEU.  [Reading the ballad title]  'A Showing of a Heavenly
3871    Effect in an Earthly Actor.'
3872  PAROLLES. That's it; I would have said the very same.
3873  LAFEU. Why, your dolphin is not lustier. 'Fore me, I speak in
3874    respect-
3875  PAROLLES. Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange; that is the brief
3876    and the tedious of it; and he's of a most facinerious spirit that
3877    will not acknowledge it to be the-
3878  LAFEU. Very hand of heaven.
3879  PAROLLES. Ay; so I say.
3880  LAFEU. In a most weak-
3881  PAROLLES. And debile minister, great power, great transcendence;
3882    which should, indeed, give us a further use to be made than alone
3883    the recov'ry of the King, as to be-
3884  LAFEU. Generally thankful.
3885  
3886                 Enter KING, HELENA, and ATTENDANTS
3887
3888  PAROLLES. I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the King.
3889  LAFEU. Lustig, as the Dutchman says. I'll like a maid the better,
3890    whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why, he's able to lead her a
3891    coranto.
3892  PAROLLES. Mort du vinaigre! Is not this Helen?
3893  LAFEU. 'Fore God, I think so.
3894  KING. Go, call before me all the lords in court.
3895                                               Exit an ATTENDANT
3896    Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;
3897    And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense
3898    Thou has repeal'd, a second time receive
3899    The confirmation of my promis'd gift,
3900    Which but attends thy naming.
3901
3902                     Enter three or four LORDS
3903
3904    Fair maid, send forth thine eye. This youthful parcel
3905    Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,  
3906    O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
3907    I have to use. Thy frank election make;
3908    Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.
3909  HELENA. To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
3910    Fall, when love please. Marry, to each but one!
3911  LAFEU. I'd give bay Curtal and his furniture
3912    My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
3913    And writ as little beard.
3914  KING. Peruse them well.
3915    Not one of those but had a noble father.
3916  HELENA. Gentlemen,
3917    Heaven hath through me restor'd the King to health.
3918  ALL. We understand it, and thank heaven for you.
3919  HELENA. I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest
3920    That I protest I simply am a maid.
3921    Please it your Majesty, I have done already.
3922    The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me:
3923    'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,
3924    Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever,
3925    We'll ne'er come there again.'  
3926  KING. Make choice and see:
3927    Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.
3928  HELENA. Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
3929    And to imperial Love, that god most high,
3930    Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
3931  FIRST LORD. And grant it.
3932  HELENA. Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.
3933  LAFEU. I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my
3934    life.
3935  HELENA. The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
3936    Before I speak, too threat'ningly replies.
3937    Love make your fortunes twenty times above
3938    Her that so wishes, and her humble love!
3939  SECOND LORD. No better, if you please.
3940  HELENA. My wish receive,
3941    Which great Love grant; and so I take my leave.
3942  LAFEU. Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I'd have
3943    them whipt; or I would send them to th' Turk to make eunuchs of.
3944  HELENA. Be not afraid that I your hand should take;
3945    I'll never do you wrong for your own sake.  
3946    Blessing upon your vows; and in your bed
3947    Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!
3948  LAFEU. These boys are boys of ice; they'll none have her.
3949    Sure, they are bastards to the English; the French ne'er got 'em.
3950  HELENA. You are too young, too happy, and too good,
3951    To make yourself a son out of my blood.
3952  FOURTH LORD. Fair one, I think not so.
3953  LAFEU. There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk wine-but
3954    if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known
3955    thee already.
3956  HELENA.  [To BERTRAM]  I dare not say I take you; but I give
3957    Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
3958    Into your guiding power. This is the man.
3959  KING. Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.
3960  BERTRAM. My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your Highness,
3961    In such a business give me leave to use
3962    The help of mine own eyes.
3963  KING. Know'st thou not, Bertram,
3964    What she has done for me?
3965  BERTRAM. Yes, my good lord;  
3966    But never hope to know why I should marry her.
3967  KING. Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed.
3968  BERTRAM. But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
3969    Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
3970    She had her breeding at my father's charge.
3971    A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
3972    Rather corrupt me ever!
3973  KING. 'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
3974    I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
3975    Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
3976    Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
3977    In differences so mighty. If she be
3978    All that is virtuous-save what thou dislik'st,
3979    A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st
3980    Of virtue for the name; but do not so.
3981    From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
3982    The place is dignified by the doer's deed;
3983    Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
3984    It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
3985    Is good without a name. Vileness is so:  
3986    The property by what it is should go,
3987    Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
3988    In these to nature she's immediate heir;
3989    And these breed honour. That is honour's scorn
3990    Which challenges itself as honour's born
3991    And is not like the sire. Honours thrive
3992    When rather from our acts we them derive
3993    Than our fore-goers. The mere word's a slave,
3994    Debauch'd on every tomb, on every grave
3995    A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
3996    Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
3997    Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
3998    If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
3999    I can create the rest. Virtue and she
4000    Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.
4001  BERTRAM. I cannot love her, nor will strive to do 't.
4002  KING. Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.
4003  HELENA. That you are well restor'd, my lord, I'm glad.
4004    Let the rest go.
4005  KING. My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,  
4006    I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
4007    Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,
4008    That dost in vile misprision shackle up
4009    My love and her desert; that canst not dream
4010    We, poising us in her defective scale,
4011    Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know
4012    It is in us to plant thine honour where
4013    We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;
4014    Obey our will, which travails in thy good;
4015    Believe not thy disdain, but presently
4016    Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
4017    Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
4018    Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
4019    Into the staggers and the careless lapse
4020    Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
4021    Loosing upon thee in the name of justice,
4022    Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.
4023  BERTRAM. Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
4024    My fancy to your eyes. When I consider
4025    What great creation and what dole of honour  
4026    Flies where you bid it, I find that she which late
4027    Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now
4028    The praised of the King; who, so ennobled,
4029    Is as 'twere born so.
4030  KING. Take her by the hand,
4031    And tell her she is thine; to whom I promise
4032    A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
4033    A balance more replete.
4034  BERTRAM. I take her hand.
4035  KING. Good fortune and the favour of the King
4036    Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
4037    Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
4038    And be perform'd to-night. The solemn feast
4039    Shall more attend upon the coming space,
4040    Expecting absent friends. As thou lov'st her,
4041    Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.
4042              Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES who stay behind,
4043                                      commenting of this wedding
4044  LAFEU. Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you.
4045  PAROLLES. Your pleasure, sir?  
4046  LAFEU. Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.
4047  PAROLLES. Recantation! My Lord! my master!
4048  LAFEU. Ay; is it not a language I speak?
4049  PAROLLES. A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody
4050    succeeding. My master!
4051  LAFEU. Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?
4052  PAROLLES. To any count; to all counts; to what is man.
4053  LAFEU. To what is count's man: count's master is of another style.
4054  PAROLLES. You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too
4055    old.
4056  LAFEU. I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age
4057    cannot bring thee.
4058  PAROLLES. What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
4059  LAFEU. I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise
4060    fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might
4061    pass. Yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly
4062    dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden. I
4063    have now found thee; when I lose thee again I care not; yet art
4064    thou good for nothing but taking up; and that thou'rt scarce
4065    worth.  
4066  PAROLLES. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee-
4067  LAFEU. Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy
4068    trial; which if-Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good
4069    window of lattice, fare thee well; thy casement I need not open,
4070    for I look through thee. Give me thy hand.
4071  PAROLLES. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.
4072  LAFEU. Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.
4073  PAROLLES. I have not, my lord, deserv'd it.
4074  LAFEU. Yes, good faith, ev'ry dram of it; and I will not bate thee
4075    a scruple.
4076  PAROLLES. Well, I shall be wiser.
4077  LAFEU. Ev'n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack
4078    o' th' contrary. If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and
4079    beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I
4080    have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my
4081    knowledge, that I may say in the default 'He is a man I know.'
4082  PAROLLES. My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.
4083  LAFEU. I would it were hell pains for thy sake, and my poor doing
4084    eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion
4085    age will give me leave.                                 Exit  
4086  PAROLLES. Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me:
4087    scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there
4088    is no fettering of authority. I'll beat him, by my life, if I can
4089    meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a
4090    lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I would have of-
4091    I'll beat him, and if I could but meet him again.
4092
4093                         Re-enter LAFEU
4094
4095  LAFEU. Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news for
4096    you; you have a new mistress.
4097  PAROLLES. I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some
4098    reservation of your wrongs. He is my good lord: whom I serve
4099    above is my master.
4100  LAFEU. Who? God?
4101  PAROLLES. Ay, sir.
4102  LAFEU. The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou garter up
4103    thy arms o' this fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do other
4104    servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose
4105    stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'd beat  
4106    thee. Methink'st thou art a general offence, and every man should
4107    beat thee. I think thou wast created for men to breathe
4108    themselves upon thee.
4109  PAROLLES. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.
4110  LAFEU. Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel
4111    out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller;
4112    you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the
4113    commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are
4114    not worth another word, else I'd call you knave. I leave you.
4115 Exit
4116
4117                           Enter BERTRAM
4118
4119  PAROLLES. Good, very, good, it is so then. Good, very good; let it
4120    be conceal'd awhile.
4121  BERTRAM. Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!
4122  PAROLLES. What's the matter, sweetheart?
4123  BERTRAM. Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
4124    I will not bed her.
4125  PAROLLES. What, what, sweetheart?  
4126  BERTRAM. O my Parolles, they have married me!
4127    I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.
4128  PAROLLES. France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
4129    The tread of a man's foot. To th' wars!
4130  BERTRAM. There's letters from my mother; what th' import is I know
4131    not yet.
4132  PAROLLES. Ay, that would be known. To th' wars, my boy, to th'
4133      wars!
4134    He wears his honour in a box unseen
4135    That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
4136    Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
4137    Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
4138    Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions!
4139    France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;
4140    Therefore, to th' war!
4141  BERTRAM. It shall be so; I'll send her to my house,
4142    Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
4143    And wherefore I am fled; write to the King
4144    That which I durst not speak. His present gift
4145    Shall furnish me to those Italian fields  
4146    Where noble fellows strike. War is no strife
4147    To the dark house and the detested wife.
4148  PAROLLES. Will this capriccio hold in thee, art sure?
4149  BERTRAM. Go with me to my chamber and advise me.
4150    I'll send her straight away. To-morrow
4151    I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.
4152  PAROLLES. Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:
4153    A young man married is a man that's marr'd.
4154    Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go.
4155    The King has done you wrong; but, hush, 'tis so.      Exeunt

4160ACT II. SCENE 4.
4161Paris. The KING'S palace
4162
4163Enter HELENA and CLOWN
4164
4165  HELENA. My mother greets me kindly; is she well?
4166  CLOWN. She is not well, but yet she has her health; she's very
4167    merry, but yet she is not well. But thanks be given, she's very
4168    well, and wants nothing i' th' world; but yet she is not well.
4169  HELENA. If she be very well, what does she ail that she's not very
4170    well?
4171  CLOWN. Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.
4172  HELENA. What two things?
4173  CLOWN. One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her quickly!
4174    The other, that she's in earth, from whence God send her quickly!
4175
4176                        Enter PAROLLES
4177
4178  PAROLLES. Bless you, my fortunate lady!
4179  HELENA. I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good
4180    fortunes.
4181  PAROLLES. You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on,  
4182    have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?
4183  CLOWN. So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she
4184    did as you say.
4185  PAROLLES. Why, I say nothing.
4186  CLOWN. Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's tongue shakes
4187    out his master's undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know
4188    nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your
4189    title, which is within a very little of nothing.
4190  PAROLLES. Away! th'art a knave.
4191  CLOWN. You should have said, sir, 'Before a knave th'art a knave';
4192    that's 'Before me th'art a knave.' This had been truth, sir.
4193  PAROLLES. Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.
4194  CLOWN. Did you find me in yourself, sir, or were you taught to find
4195    me? The search, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find
4196    in you, even to the world's pleasure and the increase of
4197    laughter.
4198  PAROLLES. A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
4199    Madam, my lord will go away to-night:
4200    A very serious business calls on him.
4201    The great prerogative and rite of love,  
4202    Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;
4203    But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;
4204    Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,
4205    Which they distil now in the curbed time,
4206    To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
4207    And pleasure drown the brim.
4208  HELENA. What's his else?
4209  PAROLLES. That you will take your instant leave o' th' King,
4210    And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
4211    Strength'ned with what apology you think
4212    May make it probable need.
4213  HELENA. What more commands he?
4214  PAROLLES. That, having this obtain'd, you presently
4215    Attend his further pleasure.
4216  HELENA. In everything I wait upon his will.
4217  PAROLLES. I shall report it so.
4218  HELENA. I pray you.                              Exit PAROLLES
4219    Come, sirrah.                                         Exeunt

4225Paris. The KING'S palace
4226
4227Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM
4228
4229  LAFEU. But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.
4230  BERTRAM. Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.
4231  LAFEU. You have it from his own deliverance.
4232  BERTRAM. And by other warranted testimony.
4233  LAFEU. Then my dial goes not true; I took this lark for a bunting.
4234  BERTRAM. I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge,
4235    and accordingly valiant.
4236  LAFEU. I have then sinn'd against his experience and transgress'd
4237    against his valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since I
4238    cannot yet find in my heart to repent. Here he comes; I pray you
4239    make us friends; I will pursue the amity
4240
4241                         Enter PAROLLES
4242
4243  PAROLLES.  [To BERTRAM]  These things shall be done, sir.
4244  LAFEU. Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?
4245  PAROLLES. Sir!  
4246  LAFEU. O, I know him well. Ay, sir; he, sir, 's a good workman, a
4247    very good tailor.
4248  BERTRAM.  [Aside to PAROLLES]  Is she gone to the King?
4249  PAROLLES. She is.
4250  BERTRAM. Will she away to-night?
4251  PAROLLES. As you'll have her.
4252  BERTRAM. I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
4253    Given order for our horses; and to-night,
4254    When I should take possession of the bride,
4255    End ere I do begin.
4256  LAFEU. A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner;
4257    but one that lies three-thirds and uses a known truth to pass a
4258    thousand nothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten.
4259    God save you, Captain.
4260  BERTRAM. Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?
4261  PAROLLES. I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's
4262    displeasure.
4263  LAFEU. You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs and all,
4264    like him that leapt into the custard; and out of it you'll run
4265    again, rather than suffer question for your residence.  
4266  BERTRAM. It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.
4267  LAFEU. And shall do so ever, though I took him at's prayers.
4268    Fare you well, my lord; and believe this of me: there can be no
4269    kernal in this light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes;
4270    trust him not in matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them
4271    tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur; I have spoken
4272    better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand; but we
4273    must do good against evil.                              Exit
4274  PAROLLES. An idle lord, I swear.
4275  BERTRAM. I think so.
4276  PAROLLES. Why, do you not know him?
4277  BERTRAM. Yes, I do know him well; and common speech
4278    Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.
4279
4280                          Enter HELENA
4281
4282  HELENA. I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
4283    Spoke with the King, and have procur'd his leave
4284    For present parting; only he desires
4285    Some private speech with you.  
4286  BERTRAM. I shall obey his will.
4287    You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
4288    Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
4289    The ministration and required office
4290    On my particular. Prepar'd I was not
4291    For such a business; therefore am I found
4292    So much unsettled. This drives me to entreat you
4293    That presently you take your way for home,
4294    And rather muse than ask why I entreat you;
4295    For my respects are better than they seem,
4296    And my appointments have in them a need
4297    Greater than shows itself at the first view
4298    To you that know them not. This to my mother.
4299                                               [Giving a letter]
4300    'Twill be two days ere I shall see you; so
4301    I leave you to your wisdom.
4302  HELENA. Sir, I can nothing say
4303    But that I am your most obedient servant.
4304  BERTRAM. Come, come, no more of that.
4305  HELENA. And ever shall  
4306    With true observance seek to eke out that
4307    Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd
4308    To equal my great fortune.
4309  BERTRAM. Let that go.
4310    My haste is very great. Farewell; hie home.
4311  HELENA. Pray, sir, your pardon.
4312  BERTRAM. Well, what would you say?
4313  HELENA. I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
4314    Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;
4315    But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
4316    What law does vouch mine own.
4317  BERTRAM. What would you have?
4318  HELENA. Something; and scarce so much; nothing, indeed.
4319    I would not tell you what I would, my lord.
4320    Faith, yes:
4321    Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.
4322  BERTRAM. I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.
4323  HELENA. I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.
4324  BERTRAM. Where are my other men, monsieur?
4325    Farewell!                                        Exit HELENA  
4326    Go thou toward home, where I will never come
4327    Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.
4328    Away, and for our flight.
4329  PAROLLES. Bravely, coragio!                             Exeunt

4349               FRENCH LORDS, with a TROOP OF SOLDIERS
4350
4351  DUKE. So that, from point to point, now have you hear
4352    The fundamental reasons of this war;
4353    Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
4354    And more thirsts after.
4355  FIRST LORD. Holy seems the quarrel
4356    Upon your Grace's part; black and fearful
4357    On the opposer.
4358  DUKE. Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
4359    Would in so just a business shut his bosom
4360    Against our borrowing prayers.
4361  SECOND LORD. Good my lord,
4362    The reasons of our state I cannot yield,
4363    But like a common and an outward man
4364    That the great figure of a council frames
4365    By self-unable motion; therefore dare not
4366    Say what I think of it, since I have found  
4367    Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
4368    As often as I guess'd.
4369  DUKE. Be it his pleasure.
4370  FIRST LORD. But I am sure the younger of our nature,
4371    That surfeit on their ease, will day by day
4372    Come here for physic.
4373  DUKE. Welcome shall they be
4374    And all the honours that can fly from us
4375    Shall on them settle. You know your places well;
4376    When better fall, for your avails they fell.
4377    To-morrow to th' field. Flourish.                     Exeunt

4384
4385Enter COUNTESS and CLOWN
4386
4387  COUNTESS. It hath happen'd all as I would have had it, save that he
4388    comes not along with her.
4389  CLOWN. By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy
4390    man.
4391  COUNTESS. By what observance, I pray you?
4392  CLOWN. Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the ruff and
4393    sing; ask questions and sing; pick his teeth and sing. I know a
4394    man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a
4395    song.
4396  COUNTESS. Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.
4397                                              [Opening a letter]
4398  CLOWN. I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court. Our old ling
4399    and our Isbels o' th' country are nothing like your old ling and
4400    your Isbels o' th' court. The brains of my Cupid's knock'd out;
4401    and I begin to love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.
4402  COUNTESS. What have we here?
4403  CLOWN. E'en that you have there.                          Exit  
4404  COUNTESS.  [Reads]  'I have sent you a daughter-in-law; she hath
4405    recovered the King and undone me. I have wedded her, not bedded
4406    her; and sworn to make the "not" eternal. You shall hear I am run
4407    away; know it before the report come. If there be breadth enough
4408    in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty to you.
4409                                           Your unfortunate son,
4410                                                       BERTRAM.'
4411    This is not well, rash and unbridled boy,
4412    To fly the favours of so good a king,
4413    To pluck his indignation on thy head
4414    By the misprizing of a maid too virtuous
4415    For the contempt of empire.
4416
4417                           Re-enter CLOWN
4418
4419  CLOWN. O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers
4420    and my young lady.
4421  COUNTESS. What is the -matter?
4422  CLOWN. Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort; your
4423    son will not be kill'd so soon as I thought he would.  
4424  COUNTESS. Why should he be kill'd?
4425  CLOWN. So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does the
4426    danger is in standing to 't; that's the loss of men, though it be
4427    the getting of children. Here they come will tell you more. For my
4428    part, I only hear your son was run away.                Exit
4429
4430              Enter HELENA and the two FRENCH GENTLEMEN
4431
4432  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Save you, good madam.
4433  HELENA. Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.
4434  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Do not say so.
4435  COUNTESS. Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen-
4436    I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief
4437    That the first face of neither, on the start,
4438    Can woman me unto 't. Where is my son, I pray you?
4439  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Madam, he's gone to serve the Duke of Florence.
4440    We met him thitherward; for thence we came,
4441    And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
4442    Thither we bend again.
4443  HELENA. Look on this letter, madam; here's my passport.  
4444    [Reads]  'When thou canst get the ring upon my finger, which
4445    never shall come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body
4446    that I am father to, then call me husband; but in such a "then" I
4447    write a "never."
4448    This is a dreadful sentence.
4449  COUNTESS. Brought you this letter, gentlemen?
4450  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam;
4451    And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.
4452  COUNTESS. I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
4453    If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
4454    Thou robb'st me of a moiety. He was my son;
4455    But I do wash his name out of my blood,
4456    And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?
4457  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam.
4458  COUNTESS. And to be a soldier?
4459  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Such is his noble purpose; and, believe 't,
4460    The Duke will lay upon him all the honour
4461    That good convenience claims.
4462  COUNTESS. Return you thither?
4463  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.  
4464  HELENA.  [Reads]  'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
4465    'Tis bitter.
4466  COUNTESS. Find you that there?
4467  HELENA. Ay, madam.
4468  SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis but the boldness of his hand haply, which
4469    his heart was not consenting to.
4470  COUNTESS. Nothing in France until he have no wife!
4471    There's nothing here that is too good for him
4472    But only she; and she deserves a lord
4473    That twenty such rude boys might tend upon,
4474    And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?
4475  SECOND GENTLEMAN. A servant only, and a gentleman
4476    Which I have sometime known.
4477  COUNTESS. Parolles, was it not?
4478  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, my good lady, he.
4479  COUNTESS. A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
4480    My son corrupts a well-derived nature
4481    With his inducement.
4482  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Indeed, good lady,
4483    The fellow has a deal of that too much  
4484    Which holds him much to have.
4485  COUNTESS. Y'are welcome, gentlemen.
4486    I will entreat you, when you see my son,
4487    To tell him that his sword can never win
4488    The honour that he loses. More I'll entreat you
4489    Written to bear along.
4490  FIRST GENTLEMAN. We serve you, madam,
4491    In that and all your worthiest affairs.
4492  COUNTESS. Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
4493    Will you draw near?            Exeunt COUNTESS and GENTLEMEN
4494  HELENA. 'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
4495    Nothing in France until he has no wife!
4496    Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France
4497    Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't
4498    That chase thee from thy country, and expose
4499    Those tender limbs of thine to the event
4500    Of the non-sparing war? And is it I
4501    That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
4502    Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
4503    Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,  
4504    That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
4505    Fly with false aim; move the still-piecing air,
4506    That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
4507    Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
4508    Whoever charges on his forward breast,
4509    I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
4510    And though I kill him not, I am the cause
4511    His death was so effected. Better 'twere
4512    I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
4513    With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
4514    That all the miseries which nature owes
4515    Were mine at once. No; come thou home, Rousillon,
4516    Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
4517    As oft it loses all. I will be gone.
4518    My being here it is that holds thee hence.
4519    Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although
4520    The air of paradise did fan the house,
4521    And angels offic'd all. I will be gone,
4522    That pitiful rumour may report my flight
4523    To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day.  
4524    For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.         Exit

4533drum and trumpets
4534
4535  DUKE. The General of our Horse thou art; and we,
4536    Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
4537    Upon thy promising fortune.
4538  BERTRAM. Sir, it is
4539    A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet
4540    We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
4541    To th' extreme edge of hazard.
4542  DUKE. Then go thou forth;
4543    And Fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
4544    As thy auspicious mistress!
4545  BERTRAM. This very day,
4546    Great Mars, I put myself into thy file;
4547    Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
4548    A lover of thy drum, hater of love.                   Exeunt

4555
4556Enter COUNTESS and STEWARD
4557
4558  COUNTESS. Alas! and would you take the letter of her?
4559    Might you not know she would do as she has done
4560    By sending me a letter? Read it again.
4561  STEWARD.  [Reads]  'I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone.
4562    Ambitious love hath so in me offended
4563    That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,
4564    With sainted vow my faults to have amended.
4565    Write, write, that from the bloody course of war
4566    My dearest master, your dear son, may hie.
4567    Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
4568    His name with zealous fervour sanctify.
4569    His taken labours bid him me forgive;
4570    I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth
4571    From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
4572    Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth.
4573    He is too good and fair for death and me;
4574    Whom I myself embrace to set him free.'  
4575  COUNTESS. Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
4576    Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much
4577    As letting her pass so; had I spoke with her,
4578    I could have well diverted her intents,
4579    Which thus she hath prevented.
4580  STEWARD. Pardon me, madam;
4581    If I had given you this at over-night,
4582    She might have been o'er ta'en; and yet she writes
4583    Pursuit would be but vain.
4584  COUNTESS. What angel shall
4585    Bless this unworthy husband? He cannot thrive,
4586    Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
4587    And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
4588    Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
4589    To this unworthy husband of his wife;
4590    Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
4591    That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,
4592    Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
4593    Dispatch the most convenient messenger.
4594    When haply he shall hear that she is gone  
4595    He will return; and hope I may that she,
4596    Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
4597    Led hither by pure love. Which of them both
4598    Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense
4599    To make distinction. Provide this messenger.
4600    My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak;

4607
4608Without the walls of Florence
4609A tucket afar off. Enter an old WIDOW OF FLORENCE, her daughter DIANA,
4610VIOLENTA, and MARIANA, with other CITIZENS
4611
4612  WIDOW. Nay, come; for if they do approach the city we shall lose
4613    all the sight.
4614  DIANA. They say the French count has done most honourable service.
4615  WIDOW. It is reported that he has taken their great'st commander;
4616    and that with his own hand he slew the Duke's brother.  [Tucket]
4617    We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way. Hark! you
4618    may know by their trumpets.
4619  MARIANA. Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with the
4620    report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl; the
4621    honour of a maid is her name, and no legacy is so rich as
4622    honesty.
4623  WIDOW. I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a
4624    gentleman his companion.
4625  MARIANA. I know that knave, hang him! one Parolles; a filthy
4626    officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. Beware of  
4627    them, Diana: their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all
4628    these engines of lust, are not the things they go under; many a
4629    maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example, that
4630    so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all that
4631    dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs that
4632    threatens them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but I
4633    hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there
4634    were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost.
4635  DIANA. You shall not need to fear me.
4636
4637            Enter HELENA in the dress of a pilgrim
4638
4639  WIDOW. I hope so. Look, here comes a pilgrim. I know she will lie
4640    at my house: thither they send one another. I'll question her.
4641    God save you, pilgrim! Whither are bound?
4642  HELENA. To Saint Jaques le Grand.
4643    Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?
4644  WIDOW. At the Saint Francis here, beside the port.
4645  HELENA. Is this the way?
4646                                                  [A march afar]  
4647  WIDOW. Ay, marry, is't. Hark you! They come this way.
4648    If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,
4649    But till the troops come by,
4650    I will conduct you where you shall be lodg'd;
4651    The rather for I think I know your hostess
4652    As ample as myself.
4653  HELENA. Is it yourself?
4654  WIDOW. If you shall please so, pilgrim.
4655  HELENA. I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.
4656  WIDOW. You came, I think, from France?
4657  HELENA. I did so.
4658  WIDOW. Here you shall see a countryman of yours
4659    That has done worthy service.
4660  HELENA. His name, I pray you.
4661  DIANA. The Count Rousillon. Know you such a one?
4662  HELENA. But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him;
4663    His face I know not.
4664  DIANA. What some'er he is,
4665    He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
4666    As 'tis reported, for the King had married him  
4667    Against his liking. Think you it is so?
4668  HELENA. Ay, surely, mere the truth; I know his lady.
4669  DIANA. There is a gentleman that serves the Count
4670    Reports but coarsely of her.
4671  HELENA. What's his name?
4672  DIANA. Monsieur Parolles.
4673  HELENA. O, I believe with him,
4674    In argument of praise, or to the worth
4675    Of the great Count himself, she is too mean
4676    To have her name repeated; all her deserving
4677    Is a reserved honesty, and that
4678    I have not heard examin'd.
4679  DIANA. Alas, poor lady!
4680    'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
4681    Of a detesting lord.
4682  WIDOW. I sweet, good creature, wheresoe'er she is
4683    Her heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do her
4684    A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.
4685  HELENA. How do you mean?
4686    May be the amorous Count solicits her  
4687    In the unlawful purpose.
4688  WIDOW. He does, indeed;
4689    And brokes with all that can in such a suit
4690    Corrupt the tender honour of a maid;
4691    But she is arm'd for him, and keeps her guard
4692    In honestest defence.
4693
4694    Enter, with drum and colours, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the
4695                          whole ARMY
4696
4697  MARIANA. The gods forbid else!
4698  WIDOW. So, now they come.
4699    That is Antonio, the Duke's eldest son;
4700    That, Escalus.
4701  HELENA. Which is the Frenchman?
4702  DIANA. He-
4703    That with the plume; 'tis a most gallant fellow.
4704    I would he lov'd his wife; if he were honester
4705    He were much goodlier. Is't not a handsome gentleman?
4706  HELENA. I like him well.  
4707  DIANA. 'Tis pity he is not honest. Yond's that same knave
4708    That leads him to these places; were I his lady
4709    I would poison that vile rascal.
4710  HELENA. Which is he?
4711  DIANA. That jack-an-apes with scarfs. Why is he melancholy?
4712  HELENA. Perchance he's hurt i' th' battle.
4713  PAROLLES. Lose our drum! well.
4714  MARIANA. He's shrewdly vex'd at something.
4715    Look, he has spied us.
4716  WIDOW. Marry, hang you!
4717  MARIANA. And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!
4718                              Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and ARMY
4719  WIDOW. The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you
4720    Where you shall host. Of enjoin'd penitents
4721    There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,
4722    Already at my house.
4723  HELENA. I humbly thank you.
4724    Please it this matron and this gentle maid
4725    To eat with us to-night; the charge and thanking
4726    Shall be for me, and, to requite you further,  
4727    I will bestow some precepts of this virgin,
4728    Worthy the note.
4729    BOTH. We'll take your offer kindly.                   Exeunt

4735Camp before Florence
4736
4737Enter BERTRAM, and the two FRENCH LORDS
4738
4739  SECOND LORD. Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his way.
4740  FIRST LORD. If your lordship find him not a hiding, hold me no more
4741    in your respect.
4742  SECOND LORD. On my life, my lord, a bubble.
4743  BERTRAM. Do you think I am so far deceived in him?
4744  SECOND LORD. Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
4745    without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a
4746    most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly
4747    promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your
4748    lordship's entertainment.
4749  FIRST LORD. It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his
4750    virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty
4751    business in a main danger fail you.
4752  BERTRAM. I would I knew in what particular action to try him.
4753  FIRST LORD. None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which
4754    you hear him so confidently undertake to do.
4755  SECOND LORD. I with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise  
4756    him; such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy.
4757    We will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other
4758    but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when
4759    we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at
4760    his examination; if he do not, for the promise of his life and in
4761    the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and
4762    deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that
4763    with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my
4764    judgment in anything.
4765  FIRST LORD. O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he
4766    says he has a stratagem for't. When your lordship sees the bottom
4767    of his success in't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of
4768    ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum's
4769    entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. Here he comes.
4770
4771                      Enter PAROLLES
4772
4773  SECOND LORD. O, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of
4774    his design; let him fetch off his drum in any hand.
4775  BERTRAM. How now, monsieur! This drum sticks sorely in your  
4776    disposition.
4777  FIRST LORD. A pox on 't; let it go; 'tis but a drum.
4778  PAROLLES. But a drum! Is't but a drum? A drum so lost! There was
4779    excellent command: to charge in with our horse upon our own
4780    wings, and to rend our own soldiers!
4781  FIRST LORD. That was not to be blam'd in the command of the
4782    service; it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not
4783    have prevented, if he had been there to command.
4784  BERTRAM. Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success.
4785    Some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to
4786    be recovered.
4787  PAROLLES. It might have been recovered.
4788  BERTRAM. It might, but it is not now.
4789  PAROLLES. It is to be recovered. But that the merit of service is
4790    seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have
4791    that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.'
4792  BERTRAM. Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur. If you think
4793    your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour
4794    again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise,
4795    and go on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit. If you  
4796    speed well in it, the Duke shall both speak of it and extend to
4797    you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost
4798    syllable of our worthiness.
4799  PAROLLES. By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.
4800  BERTRAM. But you must not now slumber in it.
4801  PAROLLES. I'll about it this evening; and I will presently pen
4802    down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself
4803    into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further
4804    from me.
4805  BERTRAM. May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it?
4806  PAROLLES. I know not what the success will be, my lord, but the
4807    attempt I vow.
4808  BERTRAM. I know th' art valiant; and, to the of thy soldiership,
4809    will subscribe for thee. Farewell.
4810  PAROLLES. I love not many words.                          Exit
4811  SECOND LORD. No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange
4812    fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this
4813    business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do,
4814    and dares better be damn'd than to do 't.
4815  FIRST LORD. You do not know him, my lord, as we do. Certain it is  
4816    that he will steal himself into a man's favour, and for a week
4817    escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him out,
4818    you have him ever after.
4819  BERTRAM. Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that
4820    so seriously he does address himself unto?
4821  SECOND LORD. None in the world; but return with an invention, and
4822    clap upon you two or three probable lies. But we have almost
4823    emboss'd him. You shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he is
4824    not for your lordship's respect.
4825  FIRST LORD. We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him.
4826    He was first smok'd by the old Lord Lafeu. When his disguise and
4827    he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which you
4828    shall see this very night.
4829  SECOND LORD. I must go look my twigs; he shall be caught.
4830  BERTRAM. Your brother, he shall go along with me.
4831  SECOND LORD. As't please your lordship. I'll leave you.   Exit
4832  BERTRAM. Now will I lead you to the house, and show you
4833    The lass I spoke of.
4834  FIRST LORD. But you say she's honest.
4835  BERTRAM. That's all the fault. I spoke with her but once,  
4836    And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,
4837    By this same coxcomb that we have i' th' wind,
4838    Tokens and letters which she did re-send;
4839    And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature;
4840    Will you go see her?
4841  FIRST LORD. With all my heart, my lord.                 Exeunt

4847Florence. The WIDOW'S house
4848
4849Enter HELENA and WIDOW
4850
4851  HELENA. If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
4852    I know not how I shall assure you further
4853    But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.
4854  WIDOW. Though my estate be fall'n, I was well born,
4855    Nothing acquainted with these businesses;
4856    And would not put my reputation now
4857    In any staining act.
4858  HELENA. Nor would I wish you.
4859  FIRST give me trust the Count he is my husband,
4860    And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
4861    Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
4862    By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
4863    Err in bestowing it.
4864  WIDOW. I should believe you;
4865    For you have show'd me that which well approves
4866    Y'are great in fortune.
4867  HELENA. Take this purse of gold,  
4868    And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
4869    Which I will over-pay and pay again
4870    When I have found it. The Count he woos your daughter
4871    Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
4872    Resolv'd to carry her. Let her in fine consent,
4873    As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
4874    Now his important blood will nought deny
4875    That she'll demand. A ring the County wears
4876    That downward hath succeeded in his house
4877    From son to son some four or five descents
4878    Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds
4879    In most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire,
4880    To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
4881    Howe'er repented after.
4882  WIDOW. Now I see
4883    The bottom of your purpose.
4884  HELENA. You see it lawful then. It is no more
4885    But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
4886    Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;
4887    In fine, delivers me to fill the time,  
4888    Herself most chastely absent. After this,
4889    To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
4890    To what is pass'd already.
4891  WIDOW. I have yielded.
4892    Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
4893    That time and place with this deceit so lawful
4894    May prove coherent. Every night he comes
4895    With musics of all sorts, and songs compos'd
4896    To her unworthiness. It nothing steads us
4897    To chide him from our eaves, for he persists
4898    As if his life lay on 't.
4899  HELENA. Why then to-night
4900    Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
4901    Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed,
4902    And lawful meaning in a lawful act;
4903    Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact.
4904    But let's about it.                                   Exeunt

4920ACT IV. SCENE 1.
4921Without the Florentine camp
4922
4923Enter SECOND FRENCH LORD with five or six other SOLDIERS in ambush
4924
4925  SECOND LORD. He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.
4926    When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will;
4927    though you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must
4928    not seem to understand him, unless some one among us, whom we
4929    must produce for an interpreter.
4930  FIRST SOLDIER. Good captain, let me be th' interpreter.
4931  SECOND LORD. Art not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy voice?
4932  FIRST SOLDIER. No, sir, I warrant you.
4933  SECOND LORD. But what linsey-woolsey has thou to speak to us again?
4934  FIRST SOLDIER. E'en such as you speak to me.
4935  SECOND LORD. He must think us some band of strangers i' th'
4936    adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of all
4937    neighbouring languages, therefore we must every one be a man of
4938    his own fancy; not to know what we speak one to another, so we
4939    seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language,
4940    gabble enough, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must  
4941    seem very politic. But couch, ho! here he comes; to beguile two
4942    hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges.
4943
4944                         Enter PAROLLES
4945
4946  PAROLLES. Ten o'clock. Within these three hours 'twill be time
4947    enough to go home. What shall I say I have done? It must be a
4948    very plausive invention that carries it. They begin to smoke me;
4949    and disgraces have of late knock'd to often at my door. I find my
4950    tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the fear of Mars
4951    before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my
4952    tongue.
4953  SECOND LORD. This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was
4954    guilty of.
4955  PAROLLES. What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery
4956    of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and
4957    knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts, and
4958    say I got them in exploit. Yet slight ones will not carry it.
4959    They will say 'Came you off with so little?' And great ones I
4960    dare not give. Wherefore, what's the instance? Tongue, I must put  
4961    you into a butterwoman's mouth, and buy myself another of
4962    Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.
4963  SECOND LORD. Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that
4964    he is?
4965  PAROLLES. I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn,
4966    or the breaking of my Spanish sword.
4967  SECOND LORD. We cannot afford you so.
4968  PAROLLES. Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in
4969    stratagem.
4970  SECOND LORD. 'Twould not do.
4971  PAROLLES. Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripp'd.
4972  SECOND LORD. Hardly serve.
4973  PAROLLES. Though I swore I leap'd from the window of the citadel-
4974  SECOND LORD. How deep?
4975  PAROLLES. Thirty fathom.
4976  SECOND LORD. Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
4977  PAROLLES. I would I had any drum of the enemy's; I would swear I
4978    recover'd it.
4979  SECOND LORD. You shall hear one anon.          [Alarum within]
4980  PAROLLES. A drum now of the enemy's!  
4981  SECOND LORD. Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.
4982  ALL. Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo.
4983  PAROLLES. O, ransom, ransom! Do not hide mine eyes.
4984                                            [They blindfold him]
4985  FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos thromuldo boskos.
4986  PAROLLES. I know you are the Muskos' regiment,
4987    And I shall lose my life for want of language.
4988    If there be here German, or Dane, Low Dutch,
4989    Italian, or French, let him speak to me;
4990    I'll discover that which shall undo the Florentine.
4991  FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos vauvado. I understand thee, and can speak thy
4992    tongue. Kerely-bonto, sir, betake thee to thy faith, for
4993    seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.
4994  PAROLLES. O!
4995  FIRST SOLDIER. O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.
4996  SECOND LORD. Oscorbidulchos volivorco.
4997  FIRST SOLDIER. The General is content to spare thee yet;
4998    And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
4999    To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform
5000    Something to save thy life.  
5001  PAROLLES. O, let me live,
5002    And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,
5003    Their force, their purposes. Nay, I'll speak that
5004    Which you will wonder at.
5005  FIRST SOLDIER. But wilt thou faithfully?
5006  PAROLLES. If I do not, damn me.
5007  FIRST SOLDIER. Acordo linta.
5008    Come on; thou art granted space.
5009                   Exit, PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within
5010  SECOND LORD. Go, tell the Count Rousillon and my brother
5011    We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled
5012    Till we do hear from them.
5013  SECOND SOLDIER. Captain, I will.
5014  SECOND LORD. 'A will betray us all unto ourselves-
5015    Inform on that.
5016  SECOND SOLDIER. So I will, sir.
5017  SECOND LORD. Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.
5018                                                          Exeunt

5023ACT IV. SCENE 2.
5024Florence. The WIDOW'S house
5025
5026Enter BERTRAM and DIANA
5027
5028  BERTRAM. They told me that your name was Fontibell.
5029  DIANA. No, my good lord, Diana.
5030  BERTRAM. Titled goddess;
5031    And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
5032    In your fine frame hath love no quality?
5033    If the quick fire of youth light not your mind,
5034    You are no maiden, but a monument;
5035    When you are dead, you should be such a one
5036    As you are now, for you are cold and stern;
5037    And now you should be as your mother was
5038    When your sweet self was got.
5039  DIANA. She then was honest.
5040  BERTRAM. So should you be.
5041  DIANA. No.
5042    My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
5043    As you owe to your wife.
5044  BERTRAM. No more o'that!  
5045    I prithee do not strive against my vows.
5046    I was compell'd to her; but I love the
5047    By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever
5048    Do thee all rights of service.
5049  DIANA. Ay, so you serve us
5050    Till we serve you; but when you have our roses
5051    You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,
5052    And mock us with our bareness.
5053  BERTRAM. How have I sworn!
5054  DIANA. 'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,
5055    But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
5056    What is not holy, that we swear not by,
5057    But take the High'st to witness. Then, pray you, tell me:
5058    If I should swear by Jove's great attributes
5059    I lov'd you dearly, would you believe my oaths
5060    When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
5061    To swear by him whom I protest to love
5062    That I will work against him. Therefore your oaths
5063    Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd-
5064    At least in my opinion.  
5065  BERTRAM. Change it, change it;
5066    Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy;
5067    And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
5068    That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
5069    But give thyself unto my sick desires,
5070    Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever
5071    My love as it begins shall so persever.
5072  DIANA. I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
5073    That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.
5074  BERTRAM. I'll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power
5075    To give it from me.
5076  DIANA. Will you not, my lord?
5077  BERTRAM. It is an honour 'longing to our house,
5078    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
5079    Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world
5080    In me to lose.
5081  DIANA. Mine honour's such a ring:
5082    My chastity's the jewel of our house,
5083    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
5084    Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world  
5085    In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom
5086    Brings in the champion Honour on my part
5087    Against your vain assault.
5088  BERTRAM. Here, take my ring;
5089    My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
5090    And I'll be bid by thee.
5091  DIANA. When midnight comes, knock at my chamber window;
5092    I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
5093    Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
5094    When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,
5095    Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:
5096    My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them
5097    When back again this ring shall be deliver'd.
5098    And on your finger in the night I'll put
5099    Another ring, that what in time proceeds
5100    May token to the future our past deeds.
5101    Adieu till then; then fail not. You have won
5102    A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
5103  BERTRAM. A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.
5104 Exit  
5105  DIANA. For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
5106    You may so in the end.
5107    My mother told me just how he would woo,
5108    As if she sat in's heart; she says all men
5109    Have the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me
5110    When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him
5111    When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
5112    Marry that will, I live and die a maid.
5113    Only, in this disguise, I think't no sin
5114    To cozen him that would unjustly win.                   Exit

5119ACT IV. SCENE 3.
5120The Florentine camp
5121
5122Enter the two FRENCH LORDS, and two or three SOLDIERS
5123
5124  SECOND LORD. You have not given him his mother's letter?
5125  FIRST LORD. I have deliv'red it an hour since. There is something
5126    in't that stings his nature; for on the reading it he chang'd
5127    almost into another man.
5128  SECOND LORD. He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off
5129    so good a wife and so sweet a lady.
5130  FIRST LORD. Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure
5131    of the King, who had even tun'd his bounty to sing happiness to
5132    him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly
5133    with you.
5134  SECOND LORD. When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the grave
5135    of it.
5136  FIRST LORD. He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence,
5137    of a most chaste renown; and this night he fleshes his will in
5138    the spoil of her honour. He hath given her his monumental ring,
5139    and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.
5140  SECOND LORD. Now, God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves,  
5141    what things are we!
5142  FIRST LORD. Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course of
5143    all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain
5144    to their abhorr'd ends; so he that in this action contrives
5145    against his own nobility, in his proper stream, o'erflows
5146    himself.
5147  SECOND LORD. Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our
5148    unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company to-night?
5149  FIRST LORD. Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.
5150  SECOND LORD. That approaches apace. I would gladly have him see his
5151    company anatomiz'd, that he might take a measure of his own
5152    judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.
5153  FIRST LORD. We will not meddle with him till he come; for his
5154    presence must be the whip of the other.
5155  SECOND LORD. In the meantime, what hear you of these wars?
5156  FIRST LORD. I hear there is an overture of peace.
5157  SECOND LORD. Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.
5158  FIRST LORD. What will Count Rousillon do then? Will he travel
5159    higher, or return again into France?
5160  SECOND LORD. I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether  
5161    of his counsel.
5162  FIRST LORD. Let it be forbid, sir! So should I be a great deal
5163    of his act.
5164  SECOND LORD. Sir, his wife, some two months since, fled from his
5165    house. Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand;
5166    which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she
5167    accomplish'd; and, there residing, the tenderness of her nature
5168    became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last
5169    breath, and now she sings in heaven.
5170  FIRST LORD. How is this justified?
5171  SECOND LORD. The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
5172    makes her story true even to the point of her death. Her death
5173    itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was
5174    faithfully confirm'd by the rector of the place.
5175  FIRST LORD. Hath the Count all this intelligence?
5176  SECOND LORD. Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from
5177    point, to the full arming of the verity.
5178  FIRST LORD. I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.
5179  SECOND LORD. How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our
5180    losses!  
5181  FIRST LORD. And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in
5182    tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquir'd for
5183    him shall at home be encount'red with a shame as ample.
5184  SECOND LORD. The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill
5185    together. Our virtues would be proud if our faults whipt them
5186    not; and our crimes would despair if they were not cherish'd by
5187    our virtues.
5188
5189                      Enter a MESSENGER
5190
5191    How now? Where's your master?
5192  SERVANT. He met the Duke in the street, sir; of whom he hath taken
5193    a solemn leave. His lordship will next morning for France. The
5194    Duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the King.
5195  SECOND LORD. They shall be no more than needful there, if they were
5196    more than they can commend.
5197  FIRST LORD. They cannot be too sweet for the King's tartness.
5198    Here's his lordship now.
5199
5200                        Enter BERTRAM  
5201
5202    How now, my lord, is't not after midnight?
5203  BERTRAM. I have to-night dispatch'd sixteen businesses, a month's
5204    length apiece; by an abstract of success: I have congied with the
5205    Duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife, mourn'd for
5206    her; writ to my lady mother I am returning; entertain'd my
5207    convoy; and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many
5208    nicer needs. The last was the greatest, but that I have not ended
5209    yet.
5210  SECOND LORD. If the business be of any difficulty and this morning
5211    your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship.
5212  BERTRAM. I mean the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it
5213    hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the Fool and
5214    the Soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module has
5215    deceiv'd me like a double-meaning prophesier.
5216  SECOND LORD. Bring him forth.  [Exeunt SOLDIERS]  Has sat i' th'
5217    stocks all night, poor gallant knave.
5218  BERTRAM. No matter; his heels have deserv'd it, in usurping his
5219    spurs so long. How does he carry himself?
5220  SECOND LORD. I have told your lordship already the stocks carry  
5221    him. But to answer you as you would be understood: he weeps like
5222    a wench that had shed her milk; he hath confess'd himself to
5223    Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his
5224    remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' th'
5225    stocks. And what think you he hath confess'd?
5226  BERTRAM. Nothing of me, has 'a?
5227  SECOND LORD. His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his
5228    face; if your lordship be in't, as I believe you are, you must
5229    have the patience to hear it.
5230
5231                   Enter PAROLLES guarded, and
5232                  FIRST SOLDIER as interpreter
5233
5234  BERTRAM. A plague upon him! muffled! He can say nothing of me.
5235  SECOND LORD. Hush, hush! Hoodman comes. Portotartarossa.
5236  FIRST SOLDIER. He calls for the tortures. What will you say without
5237    'em?
5238  PAROLLES. I will confess what I know without constraint; if ye
5239    pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.
5240  FIRST SOLDIER. Bosko chimurcho.  
5241  SECOND LORD. Boblibindo chicurmurco.
5242  FIRST SOLDIER. YOU are a merciful general. Our General bids you
5243    answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.
5244  PAROLLES. And truly, as I hope to live.
5245  FIRST SOLDIER. 'First demand of him how many horse the Duke is
5246    strong.' What say you to that?
5247  PAROLLES. Five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable.
5248    The troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor
5249    rogues, upon my reputation and credit, and as I hope to live.
5250  FIRST SOLDIER. Shall I set down your answer so?
5251  PAROLLES. Do; I'll take the sacrament on 't, how and which way you
5252    will.
5253  BERTRAM. All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!
5254  SECOND LORD. Y'are deceiv'd, my lord; this is Monsieur Parolles,
5255    the gallant militarist-that was his own phrase-that had the whole
5256    theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the
5257    chape of his dagger.
5258  FIRST LORD. I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
5259    clean; nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his
5260    apparel neatly.  
5261  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.
5262  PAROLLES. 'Five or six thousand horse' I said-I will say true- 'or
5263    thereabouts' set down, for I'll speak truth.
5264  SECOND LORD. He's very near the truth in this.
5265  BERTRAM. But I con him no thanks for't in the nature he delivers it.
5266  PAROLLES. 'Poor rogues' I pray you say.
5267  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.
5268  PAROLLES. I humbly thank you, sir. A truth's a truth-the rogues are
5269    marvellous poor.
5270  FIRST SOLDIER. 'Demand of him of what strength they are a-foot.'
5271    What say you to that?
5272  PAROLLES. By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I
5273    will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty;
5274    Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian,
5275    Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred fifty each; mine own
5276    company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred fifty each; so
5277    that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not
5278    to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake the
5279    snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to
5280    pieces.  
5281  BERTRAM. What shall be done to him?
5282  SECOND LORD. Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my
5283    condition, and what credit I have with the Duke.
5284  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down. 'You shall demand of him
5285    whether one Captain Dumain be i' th' camp, a Frenchman; what his
5286    reputation is with the Duke, what his valour, honesty, expertness
5287    in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with
5288    well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to a revolt.' What say
5289    you to this? What do you know of it?
5290  PAROLLES. I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the
5291    inter'gatories. Demand them singly.
5292  FIRST SOLDIER. Do you know this Captain Dumain?
5293  PAROLLES. I know him: 'a was a botcher's prentice in Paris, from
5294    whence he was whipt for getting the shrieve's fool with child-a
5295    dumb innocent that could not say him nay.
5296  BERTRAM. Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his
5297    brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
5298  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, is this captain in the Duke of Florence's
5299    camp?
5300  PAROLLES. Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.  
5301  SECOND LORD. Nay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
5302    lordship anon.
5303  FIRST SOLDIER. What is his reputation with the Duke?
5304  PAROLLES. The Duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of
5305    mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' th' band.
5306    I think I have his letter in my pocket.
5307  FIRST SOLDIER. Marry, we'll search.
5308  PAROLLES. In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there or it
5309    is upon a file with the Duke's other letters in my tent.
5310  FIRST SOLDIER. Here 'tis; here's a paper. Shall I read it to you?
5311  PAROLLES. I do not know if it be it or no.
5312  BERTRAM. Our interpreter does it well.
5313  SECOND LORD. Excellently.
5314  FIRST SOLDIER.  [Reads]  'Dian, the Count's a fool, and full of
5315    gold.'
5316  PAROLLES. That is not the Duke's letter, sir; that is an
5317    advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take
5318    heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon, a foolish idle
5319    boy, but for all that very ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up
5320    again.  
5321  FIRST SOLDIER. Nay, I'll read it first by your favour.
5322  PAROLLES. My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the behalf
5323    of the maid; for I knew the young Count to be a dangerous and
5324    lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity, and devours up all
5325    the fry it finds.
5326  BERTRAM. Damnable both-sides rogue!
5327  FIRST SOLDIER.                                         [Reads]
5328    'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
5329    After he scores, he never pays the score.
5330    Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
5331    He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before.
5332    And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this:
5333    Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;
5334    For count of this, the Count's a fool, I know it,
5335    Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
5336    Thine, as he vow'd to thee in thine ear,
5337                                                   PAROLLES.'
5338  BERTRAM. He shall be whipt through the army with this rhyme in's
5339    forehead.
5340  FIRST LORD. This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold  
5341    linguist, and the amnipotent soldier.
5342  BERTRAM. I could endure anything before but a cat, and now he's a
5343    cat to me.
5344  FIRST SOLDIER. I perceive, sir, by our General's looks we shall be
5345    fain to hang you.
5346  PAROLLES. My life, sir, in any case! Not that I am afraid to die,
5347    but that, my offences being many, I would repent out the
5348    remainder of nature. Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' th'
5349    stocks, or anywhere, so I may live.
5350  FIRST SOLDIER. We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;
5351    therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you have answer'd to
5352    his reputation with the Duke, and to his valour; what is his
5353    honesty?
5354  PAROLLES. He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister; for rapes
5355    and ravishments he parallels Nessus. He professes not keeping of
5356    oaths; in breaking 'em he is stronger than Hercules. He will lie,
5357    sir, with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool.
5358    Drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk; and
5359    in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bedclothes about
5360    him; but they know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have  
5361    but little more to say, sir, of his honesty. He has everything
5362    that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should
5363    have he has nothing.
5364  SECOND LORD. I begin to love him for this.
5365  BERTRAM. For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him! For
5366    me, he's more and more a cat.
5367  FIRST SOLDIER. What say you to his expertness in war?
5368  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, has led the drum before the English
5369    tragedians-to belie him I will not-and more of his soldier-ship
5370    I know not, except in that country he had the honour to be the
5371    officer at a place there called Mile-end to instruct for the
5372    doubling of files-I would do the man what honour I can-but of
5373    this I am not certain.
5374  SECOND LORD. He hath out-villain'd villainy so far that the rarity
5375    redeems him.
5376  BERTRAM. A pox on him! he's a cat still.
5377  FIRST SOLDIER. His qualities being at this poor price, I need not
5378    to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.
5379  PAROLLES. Sir, for a cardecue he will sell the fee-simple of his
5380    salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut th' entail from all  
5381    remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetually.
5382  FIRST SOLDIER. What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?
5383  FIRST LORD. Why does he ask him of me?
5384  FIRST SOLDIER. What's he?
5385  PAROLLES. E'en a crow o' th' same nest; not altogether so great as
5386    the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He
5387    excels his brother for a coward; yet his brother is reputed one
5388    of the best that is. In a retreat he outruns any lackey: marry,
5389    in coming on he has the cramp.
5390  FIRST SOLDIER. If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray
5391    the Florentine?
5392  PAROLLES. Ay, and the Captain of his Horse, Count Rousillon.
5393  FIRST SOLDIER. I'll whisper with the General, and know his
5394    pleasure.
5395  PAROLLES.  [Aside]  I'll no more drumming. A plague of all drums!
5396    Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of
5397    that lascivious young boy the Count, have I run into this danger.
5398    Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?
5399  FIRST SOLDIER. There is no remedy, sir, but you must die.
5400    The General says you that have so traitorously discover'd the  
5401    secrets of your army, and made such pestiferous reports of men
5402    very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore
5403    you must die. Come, headsman, of with his head.
5404  PAROLLES. O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!
5405  FIRST SOLDIER. That shall you, and take your leave of all your
5406    friends.  [Unmuffling him]  So look about you; know you any here?
5407  BERTRAM. Good morrow, noble Captain.
5408  FIRST LORD. God bless you, Captain Parolles.
5409  SECOND LORD. God save you, noble Captain.
5410  FIRST LORD. Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu? I am
5411    for France.
5412  SECOND LORD. Good Captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet
5413    you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon? An I were not
5414    a very coward I'd compel it of you; but fare you well.
5415                                        Exeunt BERTRAM and LORDS
5416  FIRST SOLDIER. You are undone, Captain, all but your scarf; that
5417    has a knot on 't yet.
5418  PAROLLES. Who cannot be crush'd with a plot?
5419  FIRST SOLDIER. If you could find out a country where but women were
5420    that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent  
5421    nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France too; we shall speak of
5422    you there.                                Exit with SOLDIERS
5423  PAROLLES. Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great,
5424    'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;
5425    But I will eat, and drink, and sleep as soft
5426    As captain shall. Simply the thing I am
5427    Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,
5428    Let him fear this; for it will come to pass
5429    That every braggart shall be found an ass.
5430    Rust, sword; cool, blushes; and, Parolles, live
5431    Safest in shame. Being fool'd, by fool'ry thrive.
5432    There's place and means for every man alive.
5433    I'll after them.                                        Exit

5441Enter HELENA, WIDOW, and DIANA
5442
5443  HELENA. That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you!
5444    One of the greatest in the Christian world
5445    Shall be my surety; fore whose throne 'tis needful,
5446    Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel.
5447    Time was I did him a desired office,
5448    Dear almost as his life; which gratitude
5449    Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,
5450    And answer 'Thanks.' I duly am inform'd
5451    His Grace is at Marseilles, to which place
5452    We have convenient convoy. You must know
5453    I am supposed dead. The army breaking,
5454    My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,
5455    And by the leave of my good lord the King,
5456    We'll be before our welcome.
5457  WIDOW. Gentle madam,
5458    You never had a servant to whose trust
5459    Your business was more welcome.  
5460  HELENA. Nor you, mistress,
5461    Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
5462    To recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven
5463    Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,
5464    As it hath fated her to be my motive
5465    And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!
5466    That can such sweet use make of what they hate,
5467    When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts
5468    Defiles the pitchy night. So lust doth play
5469    With what it loathes, for that which is away.
5470    But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,
5471    Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
5472    Something in my behalf.
5473  DIANA. Let death and honesty
5474    Go with your impositions, I am yours
5475    Upon your will to suffer.
5476  HELENA. Yet, I pray you:
5477    But with the word the time will bring on summer,
5478    When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns
5479    And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;  
5480    Our waggon is prepar'd, and time revives us.
5481    All's Well that Ends Well. Still the fine's the crown.

5488Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace
5489
5490Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and CLOWN
5491
5492  LAFEU. No, no, no, son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow
5493    there, whose villainous saffron would have made all the unbak'd
5494    and doughy youth of a nation in his colour. Your daughter-in-law
5495    had been alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more
5496    advanc'd by the King than by that red-tail'd humble-bee I speak
5497    of.
5498  COUNTESS. I would I had not known him. It was the death of the most
5499    virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If
5500    she had partaken of my flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a
5501    mother. I could not have owed her a more rooted love.
5502  LAFEU. 'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand
5503    sallets ere we light on such another herb.
5504  CLOWN. Indeed, sir, she was the sweet-marjoram of the sallet, or,
5505    rather, the herb of grace.
5506  LAFEU. They are not sallet-herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.
5507  CLOWN. I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in
5508    grass.  
5509  LAFEU. Whether dost thou profess thyself-a knave or a fool?
5510  CLOWN. A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.
5511  LAFEU. Your distinction?
5512  CLOWN. I would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service.
5513  LAFEU. So you were a knave at his service, indeed.
5514  CLOWN. And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.
5515  LAFEU. I will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.
5516  CLOWN. At your service.
5517  LAFEU. No, no, no.
5518  CLOWN. Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a
5519    prince as you are.
5520  LAFEU. Who's that? A Frenchman?
5521  CLOWN. Faith, sir, 'a has an English name; but his fisnomy is more
5522    hotter in France than there.
5523  LAFEU. What prince is that?
5524  CLOWN. The Black Prince, sir; alias, the Prince of Darkness; alias,
5525    the devil.
5526  LAFEU. Hold thee, there's my purse. I give thee not this to suggest
5527    thee from thy master thou talk'st of; serve him still.
5528  CLOWN. I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire;  
5529    and the master I speak of ever keeps a good fire. But, sure, he
5530    is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain in's court. I
5531    am for the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be too
5532    little for pomp to enter. Some that humble themselves may; but
5533    the many will be too chill and tender: and they'll be for the
5534    flow'ry way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
5535  LAFEU. Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I tell thee
5536    so before, because I would not fall out with thee. Go thy ways;
5537    let my horses be well look'd to, without any tricks.
5538  CLOWN. If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be jades'
5539    tricks, which are their own right by the law of nature.
5540 Exit
5541  LAFEU. A shrewd knave, and an unhappy.
5542  COUNTESS. So 'a is. My lord that's gone made himself much  sport
5543    out of him. By his authority he remains here, which he thinks is
5544    a patent for his sauciness; and indeed he has no pace, but runs
5545    where he will.
5546  LAFEU. I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to tell
5547    you, since I heard of the good lady's death, and that my lord
5548    your son was upon his return home, I moved the King my master to  
5549    speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of
5550    them both, his Majesty out of a self-gracious remembrance did
5551    first propose. His Highness hath promis'd me to do it; and, to
5552    stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son, there
5553    is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?
5554  COUNTESS. With very much content, my lord; and I wish it happily
5555    effected.
5556  LAFEU. His Highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as
5557    when he number'd thirty; 'a will be here to-morrow, or I am
5558    deceiv'd by him that in such intelligence hath seldom fail'd.
5559  COUNTESS. It rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die.
5560    I have letters that my son will be here to-night. I shall beseech
5561    your lordship to remain with me tal they meet together.
5562  LAFEU. Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be
5563    admitted.
5564  COUNTESS. You need but plead your honourable privilege.
5565  LAFEU. Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but, I thank my
5566    God, it holds yet.
5567
5568                         Re-enter CLOWN  
5569
5570  CLOWN. O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of velvet
5571    on's face; whether there be a scar under 't or no, the velvet
5572    knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of velvet. His left cheek is a
5573    cheek of two pile and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare.
5574  LAFEU. A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good liv'ry of
5575    honour; so belike is that.
5576  CLOWN. But it is your carbonado'd face.
5577  LAFEU. Let us go see your son, I pray you;
5578    I long to talk with the young noble soldier.
5579  CLOWN. Faith, there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine hats, and
5580    most courteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man.
5581                                                          Exeunt

5598Marseilles. A street
5599
5600Enter HELENA, WIDOW, and DIANA, with two ATTENDANTS
5601
5602  HELENA. But this exceeding posting day and night
5603    Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it.
5604    But since you have made the days and nights as one,
5605    To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,
5606    Be bold you do so grow in my requital
5607    As nothing can unroot you.
5608
5609                      Enter a GENTLEMAN
5610
5611    In happy time!
5612    This man may help me to his Majesty's ear,
5613    If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.
5614  GENTLEMAN. And you.
5615  HELENA. Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.
5616  GENTLEMAN. I have been sometimes there.
5617  HELENA. I do presume, sir, that you are not fall'n
5618    From the report that goes upon your goodness;  
5619    And therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,
5620    Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
5621    The use of your own virtues, for the which
5622    I shall continue thankful.
5623  GENTLEMAN. What's your will?
5624  HELENA. That it will please you
5625    To give this poor petition to the King;
5626    And aid me with that store of power you have
5627    To come into his presence.
5628  GENTLEMAN. The King's not here.
5629  HELENA. Not here, sir?
5630  GENTLEMAN. Not indeed.
5631    He hence remov'd last night, and with more haste
5632    Than is his use.
5633  WIDOW. Lord, how we lose our pains!
5634  HELENA. All's Well That Ends Well yet,
5635    Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.
5636    I do beseech you, whither is he gone?
5637  GENTLEMAN. Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;
5638    Whither I am going.  
5639  HELENA. I do beseech you, sir,
5640    Since you are like to see the King before me,
5641    Commend the paper to his gracious hand;
5642    Which I presume shall render you no blame,
5643    But rather make you thank your pains for it.
5644    I will come after you with what good speed
5645    Our means will make us means.
5646  GENTLEMAN. This I'll do for you.
5647  HELENA. And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,
5648    Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again;
5649    Go, go, provide.                                      Exeunt

5654ACT V SCENE 2.
5655Rousillon. The inner court of the COUNT'S palace
5656
5657Enter CLOWN and PAROLLES
5658
5659  PAROLLES. Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this letter. I
5660    have ere now, sir, been better known to you, when I have held
5661    familiarity with fresher clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in
5662    Fortune's mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong
5663    displeasure.
5664  CLOWN. Truly, Fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it smell
5665    so strongly as thou speak'st of. I will henceforth eat no fish
5666    of Fortune's butt'ring. Prithee, allow the wind.
5667  PAROLLES. Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake but by
5668    a metaphor.
5669  CLOWN. Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose; or
5670    against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get thee further.
5671  PAROLLES. Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.
5672  CLOWN. Foh! prithee stand away. A paper from Fortune's close-stool
5673    to give to a nobleman! Look here he comes himself.
5674
5675                           Enter LAFEU  
5676
5677    Here is a pur of Fortune's, sir, or of Fortune's cat, but not
5678    a musk-cat, that has fall'n into the unclean fishpond of her
5679    displeasure, and, as he says, is muddied withal. Pray you, sir,
5680    use the carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,
5681    ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his distress
5682    in my similes of comfort, and leave him to your lordship.
5683 Exit
5684  PAROLLES. My lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratch'd.
5685  LAFEU. And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to pare her
5686    nails now. Wherein have you played the knave with Fortune, that
5687    she should scratch you, who of herself is a good lady and would
5688    not have knaves thrive long under her? There's a cardecue for
5689    you. Let the justices make you and Fortune friends; I am for
5690    other business.
5691  PAROLLES. I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.
5692  LAFEU. You beg a single penny more; come, you shall ha't; save your
5693    word.
5694  PAROLLES. My name, my good lord, is Parolles.
5695  LAFEU. You beg more than word then. Cox my passion! give me your  
5696    hand. How does your drum?
5697  PAROLLES. O my good lord, you were the first that found me.
5698  LAFEU. Was I, in sooth? And I was the first that lost thee.
5699  PAROLLES. It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for
5700    you did bring me out.
5701  LAFEU. Out upon thee, knave! Dost thou put upon me at once both the
5702    office of God and the devil? One brings the in grace, and the
5703    other brings thee out.    [Trumpets sound]  The King's coming; I
5704    know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me; I had
5705    talk of you last night. Though you are a fool and a knave, you
5706    shall eat. Go to; follow.
5707  PAROLLES. I praise God for you.                         Exeunt

5712ACT V SCENE 3.
5713Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace
5714
5715Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two FRENCH LORDS, with ATTENDANTS
5716
5717  KING. We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem
5718    Was made much poorer by it; but your son,
5719    As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know
5720    Her estimation home.
5721  COUNTESS. 'Tis past, my liege;
5722    And I beseech your Majesty to make it
5723    Natural rebellion, done i' th' blaze of youth,
5724    When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,
5725    O'erbears it and burns on.
5726  KING. My honour'd lady,
5727    I have forgiven and forgotten all;
5728    Though my revenges were high bent upon him
5729    And watch'd the time to shoot.
5730  LAFEU. This I must say-
5731    But first, I beg my pardon: the young lord
5732    Did to his Majesty, his mother, and his lady,  
5733    Offence of mighty note; but to himself
5734    The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
5735    Whose beauty did astonish the survey
5736    Of richest eyes; whose words all ears took captive;
5737    Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
5738    Humbly call'd mistress.
5739  KING. Praising what is lost
5740    Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;
5741    We are reconcil'd, and the first view shall kill
5742    All repetition. Let him not ask our pardon;
5743    The nature of his great offence is dead,
5744    And deeper than oblivion do we bury
5745    Th' incensing relics of it; let him approach,
5746    A stranger, no offender; and inform him
5747    So 'tis our will he should.
5748  GENTLEMAN. I shall, my liege.                 Exit GENTLEMAN
5749  KING. What says he to your daughter? Have you spoke?
5750  LAFEU. All that he is hath reference to your Highness.
5751  KING. Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me
5752    That sets him high in fame.  
5753
5754                          Enter BERTRAM
5755
5756  LAFEU. He looks well on 't.
5757  KING. I am not a day of season,
5758    For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
5759    In me at once. But to the brightest beams
5760    Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;
5761    The time is fair again.
5762  BERTRAM. My high-repented blames,
5763    Dear sovereign, pardon to me.
5764  KING. All is whole;
5765    Not one word more of the consumed time.
5766    Let's take the instant by the forward top;
5767    For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees
5768    Th' inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
5769    Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
5770    The daughter of this lord?
5771  BERTRAM. Admiringly, my liege. At first
5772    I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart  
5773    Durst make too bold herald of my tongue;
5774    Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
5775    Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
5776    Which warp'd the line of every other favour,
5777    Scorn'd a fair colour or express'd it stol'n,
5778    Extended or contracted all proportions
5779    To a most hideous object. Thence it came
5780    That she whom all men prais'd, and whom myself,
5781    Since I have lost, have lov'd, was in mine eye
5782    The dust that did offend it.
5783  KING. Well excus'd.
5784    That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
5785    From the great compt; but love that comes too late,
5786    Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
5787    To the great sender turns a sour offence,
5788    Crying 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults
5789    Make trivial price of serious things we have,
5790    Not knowing them until we know their grave.
5791    Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
5792    Destroy our friends, and after weep their dust;  
5793    Our own love waking cries to see what's done,
5794    While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.
5795    Be this sweet Helen's knell. And now forget her.
5796    Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin.
5797    The main consents are had; and here we'll stay
5798    To see our widower's second marriage-day.
5799  COUNTESS. Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
5800    Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!
5801  LAFEU. Come on, my son, in whom my house's name
5802    Must be digested; give a favour from you,
5803    To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
5804    That she may quickly come.
5805                                          [BERTRAM gives a ring]
5806    By my old beard,
5807    And ev'ry hair that's on 't, Helen, that's dead,
5808    Was a sweet creature; such a ring as this,
5809    The last that e'er I took her leave at court,
5810    I saw upon her finger.
5811  BERTRAM. Hers it was not.
5812  KING. Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,  
5813    While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.
5814    This ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen
5815    I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
5816    Necessitied to help, that by this token
5817    I would relieve her. Had you that craft to reave her
5818    Of what should stead her most?
5819  BERTRAM. My gracious sovereign,
5820    Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,
5821    The ring was never hers.
5822  COUNTESS. Son, on my life,
5823    I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it
5824    At her life's rate.
5825  LAFEU. I am sure I saw her wear it.
5826  BERTRAM. You are deceiv'd, my lord; she never saw it.
5827    In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
5828    Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name
5829    Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought
5830    I stood engag'd; but when I had subscrib'd
5831    To mine own fortune, and inform'd her fully
5832    I could not answer in that course of honour  
5833    As she had made the overture, she ceas'd,
5834    In heavy satisfaction, and would never
5835    Receive the ring again.
5836  KING. Plutus himself,
5837    That knows the tinct and multiplying med'cine,
5838    Hath not in nature's mystery more science
5839    Than I have in this ring. 'Twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
5840    Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
5841    That you are well acquainted with yourself,
5842    Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
5843    You got it from her. She call'd the saints to surety
5844    That she would never put it from her finger
5845    Unless she gave it to yourself in bed-
5846    Where you have never come- or sent it us
5847    Upon her great disaster.
5848  BERTRAM. She never saw it.
5849  KING. Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;
5850    And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me
5851    Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
5852    That thou art so inhuman- 'twill not prove so.  
5853    And yet I know not- thou didst hate her deadly,
5854    And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
5855    Her eyes myself, could win me to believe
5856    More than to see this ring. Take him away.
5857                                          [GUARDS seize BERTRAM]
5858    My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,
5859    Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
5860    Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him.
5861    We'll sift this matter further.
5862  BERTRAM. If you shall prove
5863    This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
5864    Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
5865    Where she yet never was.                       Exit, guarded
5866  KING. I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.
5867
5868                        Enter a GENTLEMAN
5869
5870  GENTLEMAN. Gracious sovereign,
5871    Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
5872    Here's a petition from a Florentine,  
5873    Who hath, for four or five removes, come short
5874    To tender it herself. I undertook it,
5875    Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
5876    Of the poor suppliant, who by this, I know,
5877    Is here attending; her business looks in her
5878    With an importing visage; and she told me
5879    In a sweet verbal brief it did concern
5880    Your Highness with herself.
5881  KING.  [Reads the letter]  'Upon his many protestations to marry me
5882    when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the
5883    Count Rousillon a widower; his vows are forfeited to me, and my
5884    honour's paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave,
5885    and I follow him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O King!
5886    in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor
5887    maid is undone.
5888                                                DIANA CAPILET.'
5889  LAFEU. I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this.
5890    I'll none of him.
5891  KING. The heavens have thought well on thee, Lafeu,
5892    To bring forth this discov'ry. Seek these suitors.  
5893    Go speedily, and bring again the Count.
5894                                               Exeunt ATTENDANTS
5895    I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
5896    Was foully snatch'd.
5897  COUNTESS. Now, justice on the doers!
5898
5899                       Enter BERTRAM, guarded
5900
5901  KING. I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you.
5902    And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
5903    Yet you desire to marry.
5904                                           Enter WIDOW and DIANA
5905    What woman's that?
5906  DIANA. I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
5907    Derived from the ancient Capilet.
5908    My suit, as I do understand, you know,
5909    And therefore know how far I may be pitied.
5910  WIDOW. I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour
5911    Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
5912    And both shall cease, without your remedy.  
5913  KING. Come hither, Count; do you know these women?
5914  BERTRAM. My lord, I neither can nor will deny
5915    But that I know them. Do they charge me further?
5916  DIANA. Why do you look so strange upon your wife?
5917  BERTRAM. She's none of mine, my lord.
5918  DIANA. If you shall marry,
5919    You give away this hand, and that is mine;
5920    You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;
5921    You give away myself, which is known mine;
5922    For I by vow am so embodied yours
5923    That she which marries you must marry me,
5924    Either both or none.
5925  LAFEU.  [To BERTRAM]  Your reputation comes too short for
5926    my daughter; you are no husband for her.
5927  BERTRAM. My lord, this is a fond and desp'rate creature
5928    Whom sometime I have laugh'd with. Let your Highness
5929    Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
5930    Than for to think that I would sink it here.
5931  KING. Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
5932    Till your deeds gain them. Fairer prove your honour  
5933    Than in my thought it lies!
5934  DIANA. Good my lord,
5935    Ask him upon his oath if he does think
5936    He had not my virginity.
5937  KING. What say'st thou to her?
5938  BERTRAM. She's impudent, my lord,
5939    And was a common gamester to the camp.
5940  DIANA. He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so
5941    He might have bought me at a common price.
5942    Do not believe him. o, behold this ring,
5943    Whose high respect and rich validity
5944    Did lack a parallel; yet, for all that,
5945    He gave it to a commoner o' th' camp,
5946    If I be one.
5947  COUNTESS. He blushes, and 'tis it.
5948    Of six preceding ancestors, that gem
5949    Conferr'd by testament to th' sequent issue,
5950    Hath it been ow'd and worn. This is his wife:
5951    That ring's a thousand proofs.
5952  KING. Methought you said  
5953    You saw one here in court could witness it.
5954  DIANA. I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
5955    So bad an instrument; his name's Parolles.
5956  LAFEU. I saw the man to-day, if man he be.
5957  KING. Find him, and bring him hither.        Exit an ATTENDANT
5958  BERTRAM. What of him?
5959    He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,
5960    With all the spots o' th' world tax'd and debauch'd,
5961    Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
5962    Am I or that or this for what he'll utter
5963    That will speak anything?
5964  KING. She hath that ring of yours.
5965  BERTRAM. I think she has. Certain it is I lik'd her,
5966    And boarded her i' th' wanton way of youth.
5967    She knew her distance, and did angle for me,
5968    Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
5969    As all impediments in fancy's course
5970    Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
5971    Her infinite cunning with her modern grace
5972    Subdu'd me to her rate. She got the ring;  
5973    And I had that which any inferior might
5974    At market-price have bought.
5975  DIANA. I must be patient.
5976    You that have turn'd off a first so noble wife
5977    May justly diet me. I pray you yet-
5978    Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband-
5979    Send for your ring, I will return it home,
5980    And give me mine again.
5981  BERTRAM. I have it not.
5982  KING. What ring was yours, I pray you?
5983  DIANA. Sir, much like
5984    The same upon your finger.
5985  KING. Know you this ring? This ring was his of late.
5986  DIANA. And this was it I gave him, being abed.
5987  KING. The story, then, goes false you threw it him
5988    Out of a casement.
5989  DIANA. I have spoke the truth.
5990
5991                       Enter PAROLLES
5992  
5993  BERTRAM. My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.
5994  KING. You boggle shrewdly; every feather starts you.
5995    Is this the man you speak of?
5996  DIANA. Ay, my lord.
5997  KING. Tell me, sirrah-but tell me true I charge you,
5998    Not fearing the displeasure of your master,
5999    Which, on your just proceeding, I'll keep off-
6000    By him and by this woman here what know you?
6001  PAROLLES. So please your Majesty, my master hath been an honourable
6002    gentleman; tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.
6003  KING. Come, come, to th' purpose. Did he love this woman?
6004  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?
6005  KING. How, I pray you?
6006  PAROLLES. He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.
6007  KING. How is that?
6008  PAROLLES. He lov'd her, sir, and lov'd her not.
6009  KING. As thou art a knave and no knave.
6010    What an equivocal companion is this!
6011  PAROLLES. I am a poor man, and at your Majesty's command.
6012  LAFEU. He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.  
6013  DIANA. Do you know he promis'd me marriage?
6014  PAROLLES. Faith, I know more than I'll speak.
6015  KING. But wilt thou not speak all thou know'st?
6016  PAROLLES. Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go between them, as I
6017    said; but more than that, he loved her-for indeed he was mad for
6018    her, and talk'd of Satan, and of Limbo, and of Furies, and I know
6019    not what. Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I
6020    knew of their going to bed; and of other motions, as promising
6021    her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak
6022    of; therefore I will not speak what I know.
6023  KING. Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are
6024    married; but thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand
6025    aside.
6026    This ring, you say, was yours?
6027  DIANA. Ay, my good lord.
6028  KING. Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you?
6029  DIANA. It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.
6030  KING. Who lent it you?
6031  DIANA. It was not lent me neither.
6032  KING. Where did you find it then?  
6033  DIANA. I found it not.
6034  KING. If it were yours by none of all these ways,
6035    How could you give it him?
6036  DIANA. I never gave it him.
6037  LAFEU. This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes of and on at
6038    pleasure.
6039  KING. This ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.
6040  DIANA. It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.
6041  KING. Take her away, I do not like her now;
6042    To prison with her. And away with him.
6043    Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
6044    Thou diest within this hour.
6045  DIANA. I'll never tell you.
6046  KING. Take her away.
6047  DIANA. I'll put in bail, my liege.
6048  KING. I think thee now some common customer.
6049  DIANA. By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.
6050  KING. Wherefore hast thou accus'd him all this while?
6051  DIANA. Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty.
6052    He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't:  
6053    I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
6054    Great King, I am no strumpet, by my life;
6055    I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.
6056                                             [Pointing to LAFEU]
6057  KING. She does abuse our ears; to prison with her.
6058  DIANA. Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir;
6059                                                      Exit WIDOW
6060    The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
6061    And he shall surety me. But for this lord
6062    Who hath abus'd me as he knows himself,
6063    Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him.
6064    He knows himself my bed he hath defil'd;
6065    And at that time he got his wife with child.
6066    Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick;
6067    So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick-
6068    And now behold the meaning.
6069
6070                     Re-enter WIDOW with HELENA
6071
6072  KING. Is there no exorcist  
6073    Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
6074    Is't real that I see?
6075  HELENA. No, my good lord;
6076    'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
6077    The name and not the thing.
6078  BERTRAM. Both, both; o, pardon!
6079  HELENA. O, my good lord, when I was like this maid,
6080    I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,
6081    And, look you, here's your letter. This it says:
6082    'When from my finger you can get this ring,
6083    And are by me with child,' etc. This is done.
6084    Will you be mine now you are doubly won?
6085  BERTRAM. If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
6086    I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.
6087  HELENA. If it appear not plain, and prove untrue,
6088    Deadly divorce step between me and you!
6089    O my dear mother, do I see you living?
6090  LAFEU. Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon. [To PAROLLES]
6091    Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher. So, I
6092    thank thee. Wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee;  
6093    let thy curtsies alone, they are scurvy ones.
6094  KING. Let us from point to point this story know,
6095    To make the even truth in pleasure flow.
6096    [To DIANA]  If thou beest yet a fresh uncropped flower,
6097    Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
6098    For I can guess that by thy honest aid
6099    Thou kept'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.-
6100    Of that and all the progress, more and less,
6101    Resolvedly more leisure shall express.
6102    All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
6103    The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.       [Flourish]

6105EPILOGUE
6106                             EPILOGUE.
6107
6108  KING. The King's a beggar, now the play is done.
6109    All is well ended if this suit be won,
6110    That you express content; which we will pay
6111    With strife to please you, day exceeding day.
6112    Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;
6113    Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.
6114                                                    Exeunt omnes
